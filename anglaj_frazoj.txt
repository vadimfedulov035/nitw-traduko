1/Mae/we're like way out here, huh?
2/Angus/in the park? yeah i guess.
3/Mae/spooky.
4/Angus/i dunno. it's pretty safe.
5/Angus/and the stars are pretty.
6/Mae/So you don’t believe in ghosts at all?
7/Angus/nah. Don’t believe in ghosts, or gods,
8/Angus/or psychic powers, or anything like that.
9/Mae/Not at all?
10/Angus/I mean there’s no evidence for them,
11/Angus/and people have really tried.
12/Mae/Did you ever?
13/Angus/Yeah, when I was a kid.
14/Mae/Tell me about it.
15/AngusAsPope/so... um...
16/AngusAsPope/i don't know how much i've ever told you
17/AngusAsPope/or how much gregg has told you
18/AngusAsPope/but i didn't have the best childhood.
19/MaeAsBell/yeah i think i heard that.
20/MaeAsBell/why was it bad?
21/AngusAsWhale/um... my dad didn't like me.
22/AngusAsWhale/and my mom didn't either.
23/AngusAsWhale/and like
24/AngusAsWhale/um
25/MaeAsCat/You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
26/AngusAsWhale/no it's fine.
27/AngusAsWhale/um my dad
28/AngusAsWhale/used to hit me a lot
29/AngusAsWhale/and my mom was probably worse
30/AngusAsWhale/she like wouldn't feed me
31/AngusAsWhale/which is why i really like cooking now ha ha
32/AngusAsPope/she'd like shove me into the pantry
33/AngusAsPope/and slam the door really hard
34/AngusAsPope/and all the stuff would fall off the shelves on top of me.
35/MaeAsBell/oh my god, angus
36/MaeAsBell/i didn't know at all.
37/MaeAsBell/That's awful.
38/AngusAsPope/she'd lock me in there for like a day at a time sometimes
39/AngusAsPope/or overnight.
40/AngusAsPope/so I'd like try to develop psychic powers
41/AngusAsPope/so i could like signal the neighbors
42/AngusAsPope/or unlatch the door.
43/AngusAsPope/didn't work, as you might guess.
44/MaeAsCat/did you ever tell anybody?
45/AngusAsWhale/i never did.
46/AngusAsWhale/i don't know why.
47/AngusAsWhale/after a while I like...
48/AngusAsWhale/started feeling guilty too for some reason.
49/AngusAsWhale/like this was something bad i was doing?
50/MaeAsCat/like... being abused?
51/MaeAsCat/Angus that's not your fault at all.
52/MaeAsCat/you were a kid!!!
53/AngusAsPope/oh don't worry, i know that now.
54/AngusAsPope/boy do i ever.
55/MaeAsBell/question: can i go kick all of their asses?
56/MaeAsBell/like i've got experience. i can eff some shit up.
57/AngusAsPope/well, my mom is kinda old now.
58/AngusAsPope/i... ugh... still have to visit her sometimes.
59/AngusAsPope/i have a brother, he's overseas in the army.
60/AngusAsPope/and my dad left like 10 years ago.
61/AngusAsPope/so who knows where he is or if he's even alive.
62/AngusAsPope/if he is alive i don't want to know about it.
63/MaeAsBell/Angus I just want to give you a hug forever.
64/AngusAsWhale/ha ha well
65/AngusAsWhale/i was luckier than a lot of kids
66/AngusAsWhale/i'm just glad i didn't like... yeah.
67/AngusAsWhale/anyway, to your original question-
68/AngusAsPope/testing out my psychic abilities in the pantry
69/AngusAsPope/made me really interested in both paranormal stuff and science.
70/AngusAsPope/and i joined a skeptic society on the internet
71/AngusAsPope/and that kinda ruined me on a lot of other supernatural bullshit.
72/AngusAsPope/and it gave me something to solve
73/AngusAsPope/something you could debunk or know...
74/AngusAsPope/i dunno. it saved me a little bit i guess.
75/AngusAsWhale/cuz when someone does all that stuff to you
76/AngusAsWhale/it can like make you do some bad things to yourself
77/AngusAsWhale/but anyway yeah. no ghosts or god.
78/MaeAsBell/So like...
79/MaeAsBell/I feel like if i'd been through that
80/MaeAsBell/I'd be *more* likely to want to believe in god or... something
81/MaeAsBell/do you believe in anything at all?
82/AngusAsWhale/um well so like the constellations
83/AngusAsWhale/i don't believe there's a whale out there
84/AngusAsWhale/but i uh believe that the stars exist
85/AngusAsWhale/and that people put the whale there
86/AngusAsPope/like i dunno
87/AngusAsPope/we're good at drawing lines through the spaces between stars
88/AngusAsPope/like we're pattern-finders, and we'll find patterns
89/AngusAsPope/and we like really put our hearts and minds into it
90/AngusAsPope/and even if we don't mean to.
91/AngusAsPope/so i believe in a universe that doesn't care
92/AngusAsPope/and people who do.
93/MaeAsCat/pattern-finders.
94/MaeAsCat/i feel like a lot of people don't think they found god
95/MaeAsCat/but like god found them
96/MaeAsCat/like, when they were having bad times like you did
97/AngusAsWhale/god never did
98/AngusAsWhale/i was completely alone in the pantry
99/AngusAsWhale/but a few years later
100/AngusAsWhale/Gregg did.
101/AngusAsWhale/so like
102/AngusAsWhale/the stars can stay up there and not give a shit about us
103/AngusAsWhale/but this whale is pretty cool.
104/MaeAsBell/you're an extremely good and smart person, Angus.
105/AngusAsPope/i try.
106/AngusAsPope/but i'm no more than anyone else.
107/Mae/It’s a pope
108/Mae/he breathes fire
109/Angus/oh this one is real
110/Angus/or at least the dude is
111/Mae/Rubello
112/Mae/there's a statue of him outside church
113/Angus/Oh, we never went there.
114/Not Stated/did your family go to church?
115/Angus/weddings and funerals and longest night, basically
116/Mae/i don't think those first two count.
117/Mae/those are like *events*
118/Not Stated/do you not know your saints at all?
119/Angus/nah. none of my family were into it.
120/Angus/my saints were all like... uh... astronauts and authors.
121/Mae/That sounds really funny.
122/Angus/eh.
123/Mae/my mom works up at the church now.
124/Mae/I haven't gone really since I was like 14 or 15.
125/Angus/does she mind?
126/Mae/she pretends not to.
127/Mae/ok that’s a bell.
128/Mae/and in the middle is this eye
129/Mae/lookin’ at you.
130/Angus/ok that’s uh...
131/Angus/I know this one a little from like prog rock album covers
132/Not Stated/i think the world ends when it rings
133/Mae/that makes sense. it's gonna be really loud.
134/Angus/there's no sound in space
135/Angus/i mean like basically no sound. usually.
136/Mae/that sounds really scary for some reason.
137/Angus/well at least it means
138/Angus/we're not gonna get rung to death by a bell.
139/Not Stated/i think you die when it rings when it's looking at you
140/Angus/well, crap
141/Angus/it's high up enough it's kinda always looking at all of us, right?
142/Mae/goddamn.
143/Angus/Alright. Find me some constellations.
144/Angus/Wait, are these gonna be real ones or fake ones?
145/Mae/Just ones I remember
146/Mae/or dreamed that one time
147/Mae/ugh
148/Angus/Whichever.
149/Mae/Remember Mr. Chazokov?
150/Angus/Yeah! Science teacher.
151/Mae/He lives in Underhill and has a telescope on his roof
152/Mae/and I totally saw some stars through it.
153/Angus/That’s cool. Telescopes are cool.
154/Angus/Wish I had a telescope.
155/Mae/ok let’s see...
156/Mae/It’s a cat
157/Mae/he’s got arrows sticking out of him
158/Mae/and he’s chasing a diamond.
159/Angus/oh I know this one. don't remember his name.
160/Angus/he lived uh... you remember the stories about the forest god?
161/Not Stated/yeah!
162/Mae/my granddad used to tell me adina stories
163/Angus/oh ok yeah
164/Not Stated/no?
165/Angus/uh it was like a whole bunch of stories
166/Angus/there was this person Adina, and-
167/Mae/oh yeah! Adina and the Frozen Lake!
168/Angus/yeah that's one of them.
169/Angus/anyway this cat was in there
170/Angus/liked shiny things, was good at getting through the forest
171/Angus/was really good at stealing
172/Mae/oh wow yeah I used to call him Asscat when i was little
173/Angus/well then he stole a diamond from a king and got arrowed to death
174/Angus/but he was slick enough that he jumped out of his body
175/Angus/and became immortal or something
176/Mae/huh. decent.
177/Angus/extremely decent.
178/Mae/it’s a whale
179/Mae/and it’s got like the world on its back
180/Angus/oh wow that's sad
181/Not Stated/yeah
182/Mae/kind of a lot of responsibility.
183/Angus/did the whale consent to this???
184/Mae/i think it just always was that way.
185/Angus/ooooof.
186/Not Stated/why?
187/Angus/why does it have to carry the whole world?
188/Angus/like, that's really unfair!
189/Mae/ha ha yeah.
190/Angus/that is legitimately upsetting.
191/Angus/you gotta wonder why people made these up.
192/Angus/i mean, like, these specifically.
193/Angus/who saw a whale and was like "needs to be carrying something"
194/Not Stated/i mean whales are pretty big.
195/Angus/but what's the whale swimming in?
196/Mae/Space!
197/Angus/I guess it's dumb to get mad at ancient people.
198/Not Stated/they didn't know what the earth was.
199/Angus/yeah but like
200/Angus/i don't assume everything i don't understand is a whale.
201/Mae/you could start!
202/GraveDigger/Hey.
203/Mae/Sup.
204/GraveDigger/Been digging some graves.
205/Mae/Okay?
206/GraveDigger/Time to wake up!
207/ManOnHill/we know not when the lord will take us.
208/ManOnHill/brian knew the dangers of the mines
209/ManOnHill/but he loved his family.
210/ManOnHill/and like so many of us
211/ManOnHill/he put them before his own safety.
212/ManOnHill/But the god of heaven is the god of the tunnels.
213/ManOnHill/And we may rest in the knowledge
214/ManOnHill/That Brian is with Him now.
215/Crowd/Amen.
216/ManOnHill/We consign Brian to the dust, and to the care of the Lord.
217/Mae/Hello?
218/ManOnFence/What? Who’s there?
219/Mae/I’m Mae Borowski.
220/ManOnFence/What do you want, ghost?
221/Not Stated/Where am I?
222/Not Stated/Is this a funeral?
223/ManOnFence/You are in the cemetery in Possum Springs, Pennsylvania.
224/ManOnFence/But surely you know that
225/ManOnFence/for you have come here to haunt me
226/ManOnFence/on such a lonely afternoon.
227/Mae/I’m not haunting you!
228/Mae/And I’m not a ghost!
229/Mae/And it’s night!
230/ManOnFence/Of Brian Rooke. He is like you now, ghost.
231/Mae/What happened to him?
232/ManOnFence/Suffocated down the mines.
233/ManOnFence/Ed Yacynich tripped over him three weeks later.
234/ManOnFence/He was buried in coal dust.
235/Mae/Well that’s pretty horrible!
236/ManOnFence/They pull him out of the ground
237/ManOnFence/they cleaned him up
238/ManOnFence/for awhile they looked at him
239/ManOnFence/and now they’re burying him again.
240/Mae/Yeah I guess that’s kind of weird.
241/ManOnFence/Why do you speak to me, ghost?
242/Mae/Good god what are we even talking about? e_malĝoja
243/ManOnFence/Did Granny send you? To torment me?
244/Mae/Listen, I'm scared.
245/Mae/I don't remember how I got here.
246/Mae/Did I die?
247/Mae/Did my house burn down with me in it?
248/Mae/Oh my god... mom and dad...
249/ManOnFence/why do you torment me?
250/Mae/PLEASE HELP ME!!!
251/ManOnFence/sleep in the ground, ghost
252/ManOnFence/where no one may wake you
253/ManOnFence/and peace... peace... peace...
254/Mae/can't read this thing...
255/Mae/Something something mining company...
256/Mae/I think this one part says
257/Mae/population 562?
258/Mae/huh.
259/Mae/Hello?
260/Mae/Can you talk?
261/CatGod/Yes.
262/Mae/For some reason, you’re the first thing here I’ve thought to talk to.
263/Mae/Are you... god?
264/CatGod/No...
265/Mae/oh
266/Mae/So,
267/CatGod/Seconds ago little creatures are coming
268/CatGod/and they are asking if I am god
269/CatGod/and I am asking what god is
270/CatGod/and they are telling me
271/CatGod/and I am not this god
272/CatGod/and this god is nowhere
273/Not Stated/well, you can’t see god
274/CatGod/you are seeing what you are wishing, little creature
275/Not Stated/well, that’s where faith comes in i guess
276/CatGod/little creatures are explaining faith
277/CatGod/and moments ago is the beginning
278/CatGod/and i am here then and here now
279/CatGod/and there is nowhere for god to be hiding
280/Mae/...
281/Mae/so what am i doing here?
282/CatGod/monstrous existence
283/Mae/no, i mean what am I doing *here*?
284/Mae/what are you? What are those other giant animals?
285/Mae/have i been seeing ghosts?
286/Mae/there were like bits of the world...
287/Mae/i think i was on a train, but it was like a town?
288/Mae/it’s all-
289/Mae/ugh. I lost it.
290/Mae/Ok, so-
291/CatGod/A great beast is walking through the sands
292/CatGod/and they are climbing into the air
293/CatGod/and now they are making a tear
294/CatGod/and now they are gone
295/CatGod/and now you are here
296/Not Stated/what?
297/Not Stated/a... tear?
298/CatGod/With their hooves
299/CatGod/they are making a tear
300/CatGod/little creatures are wandering through the air
301/CatGod/and they are dragging in places and echoes of lives
302/CatGod/and they are asking me about god
303/Mae/my head hurts
304/CatGod/i am going to tell you something, little creature
305/CatGod/you are swimming further and further out to sea
306/CatGod/and beyond are things blind and terrible
307/CatGod/and i am showing you now
308/Mae/aaagh
309/Mae/oh god. oh god.
310/CatGod/they are blind, but they are seeing you
311/CatGod/and you are coming to them
312/CatGod/after this you are not returning here
313/CatGod/i am climbing into the air
314/CatGod/and closing the sky
315/Not Stated/why?
316/CatGod/I am tired of speaking with little creatures
317/CatGod/I am tired of speaking of god
318/Not Stated/closing the sky?
319/CatGod/yes
320/Mae/ok...
321/CatGod/I will tell you a second thing
322/CatGod/There is a hole at the center of everything
323/CatGod/and it is always growing
324/CatGod/between the stars i am seeing it
325/CatGod/it is coming
326/CatGod/and you are not escaping
327/CatGod/and the universe is forgetting you
328/CatGod/and the universe is being forgotten
329/CatGod/and there is nothing to remember it
330/CatGod/not even the things beyond
331/CatGod/and now there is only the hole
332/Mae/so... does anything mean anything?
333/CatGod/this is not a question worth answering
334/Not Stated/what about my home? What about my friends?
335/CatGod/soon they are dying
336/CatGod/soon they are rotting
337/Not Stated/what about trees in the fall? What about the leaves?
338/CatGod/bare existence, meaning nothing
339/CatGod/you are atoms
340/CatGod/and your atoms are not caring if you are existing
341/CatGod/your atoms are monstrous existence
342/Mae/then why am I here goddammit? Why was i chosen to see all of this?
343/Mae/where is this going?
344/CatGod/little creature, you are not chosen
345/CatGod/there is no one to choose you
346/CatGod/this is going nowhere
347/CatGod/we are not meeting again
348/CatGod/and the universe is forgetting you
349/CatGod/and I am remembering you
350/CatGod/but not because I am caring
351/CatGod/the beginning is moments ago
352/CatGod/the end is moments away
353/CatGod/there is no time to forget
354/CatGod/before all is forgotten
355/CatGod/goodbye, little creature
356/Gregg/Um, that was pretty much... perfect.
357/Bea/Uh... whoa.
358/Angus/Yeah.
359/Mae/All in a day's work. e_ĝoja

693/Gregg/I dunno. Angus slept pretty soundly last night.
694/Mae/hmm. Suspicious.
695/Mae/do you think those guys can get out of the mine?
696/Gregg/i guess we’re gonna find out pretty quick.
697/Gregg/did you notice anyone missing today?
698/Mae/i don’t know
699/Mae/but i don’t think a lot of those guys were people i knew.
700/Gregg/never can tell.
701/Mae/“never can tell”?
702/Mae/this kind of thing happen to you often?
703/Gregg/oh all the time.
704/Gregg/so like

710/Mae/i kinda get them.
711/Gregg/really???
712/Mae/no.

714/Mae/i don’t know.
715/Not Stated/the cosmic horror?
716/Gregg/ok yeah. That.
717/Mae/um. It’s old.
718/Mae/something older than anything i can think of.
719/Mae/and you can feel it inside
720/Gregg/and it’s… in a hole outside town?
721/Mae/yes.
722/Mae/no.
723/Mae/like, the thing in the hole is...
724/Mae/...geez i lost it.
725/Gregg/it’s ok.
726/Mae/it’s like
727/Mae/a porch light that’s on
728/Mae/and there are all these bugs around it
729/Mae/and then the light goes out.
730/Mae/and there’s a hole where the light was.
731/Mae/it’s like what happened to me way back.
732/Mae/like i was telling you about on the couch last night.
733/Gregg/god, that was last night?
734/Gregg/seems like 2 weeks ago.
735/Mae/heh heh yeah.
736/Mae/it’s going to be weird when you’re gone.
737/Gregg/well i mean
738/Gregg/you’ve already been gone.
739/Gregg/and you’ve been gone at least once since you got back.
740/Mae/at least.
741/Mae/i died a little getting that battery the other day.
742/Gregg/see?
743/Gregg/you’re a goner.
744/Mae/like, last night-
745/Mae/it feels sometimes like there’s so much horrible past
746/Mae/still trapped in the historical society from the other night
747/Mae/ha ha just realized i know what that painting was
748/Gregg/what was it?
749/Mae/nevermind.
750/Mae/but it feels like the past can’t just… *LEAVE*.
751/Mae/and it’s still here
752/Mae/you’re like swimming in it
753/Mae/and you can’t have a future.
754/Gregg/nah brah
755/Mae/“nah brah”? That’s it?
756/Gregg/what was our biggest crime ever?
757/Not Stated/almost burning down the school
758/Mae/that was like our highschool high point
759/Not Stated/bringing a horrible robot son into the world?
760/Mae/and then leaving him to haunt the woods out by the highway?
761/Gregg/actually it was probably trapping those dudes in the mine and leaving them to die
762/Mae/that was self defense!!!!
763/Gregg/all of that stuff-
764/Gregg/like, today’s different now because that happened.
765/Gregg/we’re different.
766/Mae/yeah
767/Gregg/so like
768/Gregg/things change.
769/Mae/i guess.
770/Mae/like you said the other day in the woods
771/Mae/gonna be different because we were here.
772/Gregg/that’s something.
773/Mae/something something something
774/Gregg/what a weird fall it’s been
775/Mae/yeah. I mean even aside from last night.
776/Mae/weirdest couple weeks of my life
777/Mae/like so i was asking about that pentagram sticker?
778/Mae/yeah so there were these weird teens who told me i was
779/Mae/uh… nevermind. It’s really stupid saying it out loud.
780/Gregg/ok
781/Mae/like i dunno sometimes weird coincidences
782/Mae/it’s like having the tv on in the room so you don’t feel alone
783/Mae/or something
784/Gregg/one of the best things about living with Angus
785/Gregg/is he’s always there
786/Mae/angus is your TV
787/Gregg/and my space heater.
788/Mae/so those teens told me i’d see a bunch of pentagrams

812/Mae/she like goes to the train tracks
813/Mae/and squashes these little metal toy dudes
814/Mae/and they turn into these awesome little messed up monsters
815/Gregg/i used to do that with pennies
816/Gregg/wasn’t thinking big enough i guess
817/Mae/idk. Was thinking about what it’d be like being one of those toys
818/Mae/like run over by this big massive thing you have no control over
819/Mae/and it leaves you all deformed and… i dunno...

873/Mae/you’ll like this- one was on a donut the other night
874/Gregg/infernal hails to donut wolf
875/Mae/and another was down in that tunnel last night
876/Gregg/i mean you know what Angus would say
877/Mae/ha ha yeah
878/Mae/pattern seeking
879/Mae/what?
880/Gregg/he goes off about how people see like patterns they want to see

889/Mae/and she squashes these little toy guys on the railroad tracks
890/Gregg/sounds awesome
891/Mae/i dunno. Like remember when we were teens
892/Mae/and we could do crazy shit
893/Mae/and it was like expected
894/Gregg/dude since you got home it’s been like crazy shit 24-7
895/Mae/yeah but like
896/Mae/that’s shit that *happened* to us
897/Mae/like seeing the pentagrams
898/Mae/or if you were one of those toy guys squashed by the train
899/Mae/or I dunno Bea and I getting trapped in a basement the other night
900/Gregg/i guess
901/Mae/is that the difference between being a kid and being an adult?
902/Gregg/no. not at all.
903/Mae/yeah i dunno where I was going with that.
904/Gregg/i think it’s up there for all of us
905/Mae/like even aside from all the other stuff
906/Mae/you know how i was asking you about that pentagram sticker?
907/Gregg/yeah corpsedriver’s really good
908/Mae/these three weird teens… ok, this sounds stupid…

911/Gregg/ok
912/Mae/you’ll like this- one of them was on a donut the other night
913/Gregg/ride the chariot to donut hell. It’s right in the motto.
914/Mae/oh, speaking of wierd stuff, i went to germ's house the other day.

920/Gregg/like he read it in the bite I’d taken out of a slice of pizza
921/Mae/did you get hit by a bus and die?
922/Gregg/not yet!
923/Gregg/I didn’t get killed when we were moving that box up the stairs the other night either.
924/Mae/i think that means you’re winning.
925/Gregg/maybe that’s what winning is.
926/Mae/whoa
927/Mae/so this is kind of my point-
928/Mae/are these just random things and we’ve just been lucky to not die
929/Mae/or is there like some sort of pattern or
930/Mae/i mean not god, but like…
931/Mae/something?
932/Gregg/i mean you know what Angus would say
933/Mae/ha ha yeah
934/Mae/pattern seeking
935/Mae/what?
936/Gregg/he goes off about how people see like patterns they want to see
937/Gregg/like it’s in our brains. Our brains do that.
938/Mae/you do kinda *want* there to be something making all this happen, right?
939/Mae/like even if it’s bad, it means there some sort of control
940/Mae/like someone real smart could figure it out
941/Gregg/nah. That’s creepy.
942/Mae/not any creepier than germ and his grandma and those three teens
943/Gregg/germ’s not creepy. Spooky, maybe.
944/Mae/yeah. Germ’s the bomb.
945/Mae/life’s spooky, man.
946/Gregg/you ain’t lyin
947/Mae/So I went up to Germ’s house the other day
948/Gregg/whoa, really?
949/Gregg/i’ve never been up there.

963/Mae/that was weird.
964/Gregg/Germ told my fortune once.
965/Mae/really?
966/Gregg/yeah said I’d get hit by a bus
967/Gregg/could tell from how I ate a slice of pizza
968/Mae/was he joking?
969/Gregg/hard to tell with Germ sometimes.
970/Gregg/what did his gramma say?
971/Mae/i mean if you squint... sorta what happened last night?
972/Mae/i mean she was also like really rude about my whole
973/Mae/you know
974/Mae/brain issues.
975/Gregg/blech.
976/Mae/but still, kinda spooky.
977/Gregg/Spooky family.
978/Mae/i dunno. I guess.
979/Mae/there’s this teen I’ve been hanging out with, Lori
980/Gregg/hanging out with teens are you?
981/Mae/nah. Like, she needs a role model.
982/Gregg/that's nice of you.
983/Mae/anyway she lives out by the tracks
984/Mae/and she like squishes these little metal toy guys
985/Mae/by putting them on the tracks when a train goes by
986/Gregg/oh yeah i used to do that with pennies
987/Gregg/i guess i needed to think bigger
988/Mae/So like when Germ’s grandma told my fortune
989/Mae/i couldn’t shake this feeling that it was like something else i’d seen
990/Mae/and i realized what it was last night when we were down there
991/Mae/like it all felt like i was getting squashed on the tracks
992/Mae/and i was getting all deformed and weird and shit
993/Gregg/huh
994/Gregg/that’s intense
995/Mae/like when they did that mountaintop mining south of here
996/Gregg/ugh.
997/Mae/i know right
998/Mae/like things just got all messed up and it looked all squashed down
999/Mae/i don’t know where I’m going with this
1000/Mae/man, I need like the longest nap you can imagine
1001/Mae/like one that *isn’t* in the hospital.
1002/Gregg/I mean we can go steal another car battery
1003/Mae/ha ha ha ha oh my god
1004/Gregg/put you right out
1005/Mae/sharkle can visit me again
1006/Gregg/what?
1007/Gregg/i can like bonk you over the head with something
1008/Mae/yeah do that
1009/Mae/actually no
1010/Mae/after the other night it might cause actual brain damage
1011/Gregg/how is your head?
1012/Mae/still working.
1013/Mae/oh man if you even knew
1014/Mae/so when we were at Donut Wolf the other night?
1015/Gregg/yeah
1016/Mae/I got that donut with the pentagram on it
1017/Mae/that was part of some shit these three weird teens told me would happen
1018/Mae/like it was gonna help me
1019/Mae/and last night I saw another pentagram down in the tunnel
1020/Gregg/that's why you asked me about that sticker?
1021/Mae/yeah.
1022/Gregg/i mean you know what Angus would say
1023/Mae/ha ha yeah
1024/Mae/pattern seeking
1025/Mae/what?
1026/Gregg/he goes off about how people see like patterns they want to see
1027/Gregg/like it’s in our brains. Our brains do that.
1028/Mae/ok so get this-
1029/Mae/I went to Germ’s house the other day
1030/Gregg/HOLY SHIT
1031/Gregg/i’ve never been there!
1032/Mae/oh it’s nice. Up in the woods. Got a trampoline.
1033/Gregg/aw luckyyyyyyyyyy.
1034/Mae/so his grandma told my fortune. a little. vaguely?
1035/Mae/i could have just been hearing what i wanted to hear or something?
1036/Gregg/Germ told my fortune once. Maybe it’s like a family thing?
1037/Not Stated/what did he say?
1038/Gregg/that i’d die
1039/Gregg/getting hit by a bus
1040/Mae/wow. That’s kind of a downer.
1041/Gregg/eh.
1042/Not Stated/how’d he do it?
1043/Gregg/he looked at like bite marks in some pizza we were eating
1044/Mae/pizzamancer
1045/Gregg/did you eat pizza with Germ’s gramma or something?
1046/Mae/nah. Just looked at me.
1047/Gregg/so what did she tell you?
1048/Mae/i mean if you squint... sorta what happened last night?
1049/Mae/i mean she was also like really rude about my whole
1050/Mae/you know
1051/Mae/brain issues.
1052/Gregg/blech.
1053/Mae/but still, kinda spooky.
1054/Mae/and like...
1055/Mae/ok so there’s this OTHER person, this girl Lori I’ve been hanging out with?
1056/Gregg/who’s Lori?
1057/Mae/Lori Meyers. She’s like 15, lives out by the tracks
1058/Gregg/you’re… hanging out with teens now?
1059/Mae/eh. She needs a role model.
1060/Gregg/that’s nice of you dude
1061/Mae/we were doing this thing where you put these little metal guys on the tracks
1062/Mae/and the train runs over them and they get all deformed
1063/Gregg/oh yeah i used to do that with pennies
1064/Gregg/guess i wasn’t thinking big enough
1065/Mae/the pentagram thing and germ’s grandma and just all of this
1066/Mae/germ’s grandma and just all of this
1067/Mae/like there’s some sort of thing under this holding it all together
1068/Mae/but not because it cares about us
1069/Mae/the thing in the hole, the ghost dreams or whatever, which i barely remember now
1070/Mae/even like Possum Springs, like we used to have a lot more jobs and people and stuff
1071/Mae/and now we don’t. And none of it’s anyone’s fault really
1072/Mae/anyone here and now at least
1073/Mae/when i was squashing those little toy guys with Lori
1074/Mae/i was like whoa this is us
1075/Mae/i dunno. It’s all like dream logic or whatever
1076/Mae/i feel like there are these giant-
1077/Mae/like when the mills and mine shut down
1078/Mae/but those assholes down in the tunnels thought they could bring it back
1079/Mae/or like nobody goes to the church anymore
1080/Mae/but god’s still gonna come back or something
1081/Mae/or like you leaving the sheep thing open
1082/Gregg/hey!
1083/Mae/like to them the gate’s gone
1084/Mae/and to you the sheep are gone and...
1085/Mae/then like *my* whole bullshit, and...
1086/Mae/...
1087/Mae/ok lost my train of thought
1088/Gregg/man
1089/Gregg/you’re right.
1090/Gregg/you *have* had a weird couple of weeks
1091/Gregg/you need like... something...
1092/Mae/yeah man.
1093/Mae/looking forward to longest night
1094/Mae/something to like reset everything
1095/Gregg/we got in all that Longest Night stuff at work
1096/Gregg/you can just come down there
1097/Mae/earlier and earlier every year
1098/Mae/oh i also gave us a rat infestation in town?
1099/Gregg/what?
1100/Mae/eh. It’s like the one good thing that’s happened.
1101/Mae/Hope springs. Rats Multiply.
1102/Gregg/very poetical.
1103/Mae/i’m extremely poetical.
1104/Gregg/...
1105/Gregg/they killed casey.
1106/Mae/yeah they did. they killed casey.
1107/Gregg/i'm trying not to think about it.
1108/Gregg/do we like... tell his parents?
1109/Mae/what do we tell them?
1110/Gregg/i don't know.
1111/Gregg/is it worse to let them think he's alive
1112/Gregg/or tell them he's in a bottomless hole
1113/Gregg/in a tunnel
1114/Gregg/in the woods
1115/Gregg/with a bunch of guys who are gonna be dead soon?
1116/Not Stated/we should tell them
1117/Gregg/ok
1118/Gregg/you get to figure out what we say.
1119/Mae/i'll let you know if i ever come up with anything.
1120/Gregg/sounds good.
1121/Not Stated/we shouldn't tell them
1122/Gregg/none of this feels good.
1123/Mae/how could it, man?
1124/Mae/i think it's important that we know at least
1125/Mae/makes it... mean something?
1126/Mae/i dunno how to say it...
1127/Mae/i think we might be the only things in the universe
1128/Mae/who care about anything.
1129/Mae/or who even *can* care.
1130/Mae/do you think any of this means anything?
1131/Mae/or like, meant anything?
1132/Gregg/hm.
1133/Mae/dooooooooes it, greggory?
1134/Angus/hey babies
1135/Gregg/hey hon.
1136/Mae/“babies”?
1137/Gregg/how was work?
1138/Angus/geez, i’m sore from like… everything.
1139/Mae/i ran into like a zillion bushes the other night.
1140/Mae/basically my body hates me right now.
1141/Gregg/gotta do stretches
1142/Mae/so like
1143/Mae/can I move to Bright Harbor with you guys?
1144/Gregg/!
1145/Angus/!
1146/Gregg/uh
1147/Angus/um
1148/Gregg/i thought you like couldn’t leave home?
1149/Mae/eh. You guys are home enough.
1150/Angus/…
1151/Mae/orrrrrr maybe I’ll just visit for a while once you get settled in.
1152/Angus/of course!
1153/Gregg/yeah dude that’d be rad.
1154/Mae/hey guys
1155/Angus/yeah?
1156/Mae/thanks for saving me last night. Like, repeatedly.
1157/Gregg/not even a problem dude.
1158/Gregg/we’ll save you as many times as it takes
1159/Gregg/hey bea.
1160/Mae/heeeey bea.
1161/Bea/...
1162/Mae/aaaare you gonna say something?
1163/Bea/i don’t really know what to say
1164/Bea/what in the hell even happened last night?
1165/Not Stated/ugh. Don’t ask me.
1166/Mae/can’t we just like
1167/Mae/play a song
1168/Mae/and get pizza
1169/Mae/and think about this tomorrow?
1170/Bea/i had a dream that the world was ending.
1171/Mae/song. and. pizza.
1172/Bea/alright.
1173/Mae/sweeeeet.
1174/Gregg/it does, dude.
1175/Mae/what?
1176/Gregg/answering your question like 2 minutes ago.
1177/Mae/what question?
1178/Mae/what were we even talking about?
1179/Not Stated/uh. Nothing. Nothing at all.
1180/Bea/oh good so i was just having the worst weirdest nightmare ever
1181/Bea/by the way, nice messages to wake up to
1182/Mae/ooooooh god i was half asleep let’s not talk about it
1183/Bea/i think i twisted my ankle last night
1184/Mae/can we just like not talk about last night for the rest of the day?
1185/Bea/uh
1186/Bea/no promises
1187/Mae/can’t we just play a song
1188/Mae/and get pizza
1189/Mae/and talk about this tomorrow?
1190/Angus/sure
1191/Bea/whatever
1192/Bea/we can all talk about it in therapy for years
1193/Mae/that’s the spirit
1194/Mae/i mean we have to go on, right?
1195/Mae/obviously the world is seriously screwed up but
1196/Mae/we’re all gonna die if we don’t keep living
1197/Gregg/that’s some bumper sticker shit right there
1198/Mae/hey, i know what i’m talking about
1199/Mae/we gotta make plans
1200/Mae/we gotta change things
1201/Mae/we gotta play a goddamn song and get a goddamn pizza
1202/Angus/ok so what are we playing?
1203/Bea/god. This door just does not like to open.
1204/Mae/bet it’s worse in the summer.
1205/Mae/oh wow there’s a pentagram on this sticker
1206/Bea/i can’t read the band name on it
1207/Mae/cops... driller?
1208/Bea/i guarantee you it’s not Cops Driller.
1209/Mae/maybe it’s like a german band with a name in english
1210/Mae/sounds like that
1211/Bea/Guten Tag. Ve are Cops-Driller.
1212/Mae/Off Vedersen.
1213/Bea/close enough.
1214/Mae/so did you all get keys to the back door?
1215/Bea/Gregg got one and we made copies.
1216/Mae/how’d he even get a key?
1217/Bea/i have no idea.
1218/Bea/where’s gregg?
1219/Mae/oh yeah he had to “spring” Angus from work
1220/Bea/what does that mean?
1221/Mae/zero clue.
1222/Bea/huh.
1223/Mae/I’m a little unclear about how both of them still have jobs
1224/Mae/since they seem to just up and leave work early a lot.
1225/Bea/There’s a lot about those two I don’t understand.
1226/Mae/I think they just plain need each other.
1227/Bea/Gregg more than Angus I think.
1228/Mae/I don’t think Angus would agree.
1229/Bea/that’s because it wouldn’t occur to Angus to think otherwise
1230/Bea/because Angus is an extremely nice person.
1231/Not Stated/Gregg’s a nice person!
1232/Bea/oh yeah he definitely is
1233/Bea/but he’s also bratty and irresponsible
1234/Bea/and has like zero attention span.
1235/Bea/Gregg needs a parent as much as he needs a boyfriend.
1236/Bea/and he’s really lucky Angus is a little bit of both.
1237/Not Stated/do you not think they’ll last or something?
1238/Bea/i mean, they’re high school sweethearts!
1239/Bea/once they move and change
1240/Bea/and meet new people
1241/Bea/and become new people
1242/Bea/i think angus is gonna find he’s got more options.
1243/Mae/Angus thinks Gregg, like, *saved* him.
1244/Bea/Listen, I’m not saying he didn’t, if he thinks so.
1245/Bea/Angus might also just be attracted to really sincere guys in leather jackets...
1246/Bea/who carry knives.
1247/Bea/i mean if i met the right guy those would all be plusses.
1248/Mae/geez. You’ve thought this out.
1249/Bea/before you came back
1250/Bea/they were the only people i hung out with most of the time
1251/Bea/i’ve had a lot of time to study.
1252/Bea/so like
1253/Bea/how *are* you?
1254/Not Stated/i’m… uh… Good.
1255/Bea/Really?
1256/Mae/I feel like right now I could convince myself I was fine or completely shattered.
1257/Mae/just like… stuck in neutral.
1258/Not Stated/i don’t even know
1259/Mae/i’m still processing
1260/Mae/i’m here, though.
1261/Bea/yeah.
1262/Mae/you?
1263/Bea/um. Not great?
1264/Bea/had a dream the world was ending.
1265/Mae/might be.
1266/Bea/do you think we’re safe?
1267/Mae/no idea.
1268/Bea/great feeling.
1269/Mae/yup.
1270/Bea/so like... i’m a little confused about what even happened last night…
1271/Not Stated/well, there’s apparently a deathcult of dads
1272/Mae/or was
1273/Mae/who knows if that was all of them
1274/Bea/i can’t believe they even exist. Or existed.
1275/Mae/probably take them a few days to die.
1276/Bea/...
1277/Bea/yup.
1278/Mae/i dunno. I kinda understand them in a weird way.
1279/Bea/really?!
1280/Not Stated/the whole cosmic horror thing?
1281/Bea/yeah. That.
1282/Mae/could you even see or feel it?
1283/Bea/nope. But between you and the… dads…
1284/Bea/something had to be going on
1285/Mae/it’s old. It’s very old.
1286/Mae/you can like smell how old.
1287/Mae/it’s like
1288/Mae/a porch light that’s on
1289/Mae/and there are all these bugs around it
1290/Mae/and then the light goes out.
1291/Mae/and there’s a hole where the light was.
1292/Mae/it’s like what happened to me way back.
1293/Mae/like i was telling you about on the couch last night.
1294/Bea/holy crap that was last night.
1295/Bea/seems like 2 lifetimes ago.
1296/Bea/heh heh yeah.
1297/Mae/the world is extremely bad
1298/Bea/yes. Yes it is.
1299/Mae/a… failed state?
1300/Bea/getting pretty close.
1301/Mae/weird question-
1302/Mae/how do you like get up every day
1303/Mae/and go open the store
1304/Mae/and keep doing it?
1305/Bea/i don’t really have a choice, do i?
1306/Not Stated/i mean, you definitely do.
1307/Mae/you don’t give yourself enough credit
1308/Mae/you keep all of this running because you care
1309/Bea/i guess.
1310/Bea/caring doesn’t always seem to be voluntary.
1311/Bea/caring can be really terrifying
1312/Bea/i feel like it’s always there right out of sight
1313/Bea/following me.
1314/Not Stated/i guess not.
1315/Mae/but still. Lots of people would be like
1316/Mae/destroyed by what you’ve been through.
1317/Bea/my mom was extremely tough. And smart.
1318/Bea/when i found out she was going to die
1319/Bea/it just didn’t occur to me that she was fragile
1320/Bea/like we’re all fragile.
1321/Bea/i don’t want to let her down i guess.
1322/Bea/i can’t *not* give a shit.
1323/Bea/i mean i do the store
1324/Bea/and our bills at home
1325/Bea/stuff with the chamber of commerce
1326/Bea/i’m doing free study courses online
1327/Bea/and i’m a member of the young socialists.
1328/Mae/i sleep a lot and sometimes eat pizza.
1329/Bea/“to each according to their ability”
1330/Mae/well, on the bright side, you got meeeee!
1331/Bea/heh heh yeah.
1332/Mae/we can fix the world togetherrrrrr!
1333/Bea/yup. Fix it right up.
1334/Mae/we fixed that furnace!
1335/Bea/*I* fixed that furnace.
1336/Mae/well i fixed us getting trapped in the basement.
1337/Bea/you sure did, Mae. you sure did.
1338/Bea/ugh. I guess last night wasn’t so weird.
1339/Mae/it was pretty weird.
1340/Bea/old men killing the youngs and the poors
1341/Bea/to get back some past that barely existed.
1342/Bea/same ol same ol
1343/Bea/they’re like ghosts in some old mansion
1344/Bea/killing the new owners.
1345/Bea/makes you want to either give up or try harder.
1346/Mae/or get really upset and take a nap
1347/Bea/yeah. Naps fix everything.
1348/Mae/or like drop an elevator on them
1349/Bea/that works too i guess.
1350/Mae/god i can’t even wrap my head around these past two weeks.
1351/Bea/i think that’s pretty understandable, mae.
1352/Mae/there were these three weird teens
1353/Mae/and they told me i’d see bunch of pentagrams.
1354/Bea/what teens?
1355/Mae/the ones we bumped into in the graveyard
1356/Bea/oh god. Those teens.
1357/Mae/met them up by the water tower
1358/Mae/just some dorky kids.
1359/Mae/anyway, they said if I saw three pentagrams
1360/Mae/I’d get some sort of help.
1361/Mae/I actually saw one at that party we went to.
1362/Mae/and last night, i saw the last one down in the tunnel
1363/Mae/and it made me think…
1364/Mae/you remember Adina and The Frozen Lake?
1365/Bea/the folk tale? Yeah sure.
1366/Mae/that astronomer under the ice or whatever that couldn’t find a star
1367/Mae/until after she died?
1368/Bea/the ghost star.
1369/Mae/just thinking stars are upside down if you’re looking at their reflections.
1370/Bea/that’s… true.
1371/Mae/which is what you’d see if you were a reflection in the ice-
1372/Bea/yeah i get it. I read the story.
1373/Mae/i barely noticed it when we were down there last night but today
1374/Mae/just thinking about that. This feeling like
1375/Mae/at the end of everything you can hold on to something.
1376/Mae/or anything.
1377/Mae/find the spooky ghost star
1378/Mae/put it on a map
1379/Mae/then you… uh… have a map?
1380/Mae/i dunno. I’m hungry and tired
1381/Mae/and i feel like i got run over by a train that was carrying other trains.
1382/Bea/i’m really impressed you got all of that out of teens being weird and spooky.
1383/Mae/pattern-seekers.
1384/Bea/what?
1385/Mae/something angus said.
1386/Mae/we’re good at finding patterns.
1387/Bea/yeah. It’s like a survival thing.
1388/Mae/yeah.
1389/Mae/i dunno.
1390/Mae/it meant something to me.
1391/Mae/is that enough?
1392/Bea/far be it from me to condemn spooky meaning.
1393/Mae/spooky.
1394/Mae/spoooook-k-k-k-y
1395/Mae/there’s this kid Lori
1396/Mae/i’ve been like… uh…
1397/Mae/maybe trying to be a role model?
1398/Bea/how old is she?
1399/Mae/i think 15 or so.
1400/Bea/so you’re just hanging out with a 15 year old?
1401/Mae/oh shut up. Anyway.
1402/Mae/she does this thing where she puts little metal dudes on the train tracks
1403/Mae/and like squashes them together
1404/Mae/and it makes these rad little monsters.
1405/Bea/oooh that sounds cool.
1406/Mae/yeah it’s awesome.
1407/Mae/it also made me think like
1408/Mae/if they were alive when it happened
1409/Bea/god, that’s grim
1410/Mae/if they were just destroyed and crushed by this massive unknowable thing
1411/Mae/and crammed into being one thing
1412/Mae/they’re like a new monster.
1413/Bea/twice the monster, even.
1414/Mae/like me and the fort lucenne fish god
1415/Bea/i think you actually injured a few of those people
1416/Mae/eh.
1417/Mae/anyway
1418/Mae/but like look at where we live
1419/Mae/big giant things rolled over this place
1420/Mae/and i don’t know if it made us all stronger
1421/Mae/or just made some monsters
1422/Bea/i… think it did both.
1423/Bea/like anything traumatic on that scale does both?
1424/Bea/but as much as i hate this shithole sometimes
1425/Bea/it’s home.
1426/Mae/Remember when Mrs. Crangler taught us to squaredance in girl scouts?
1427/Bea/ha ha yeah. Geez. she had that stick
1428/Mae/yeah she’d hit the ground to the beat
1429/Bea/Mrs. Crangler was serious about squaredancing.
1430/Mae/she died recently i guess.
1431/Bea/yeah. She was extremely old though.
1432/Mae/squaredancing was weird
1433/Mae/all of us just like jumbled up
1434/Mae/trying to dance, trying not to trip over each other
1435/Bea/Mrs. Crangler is dead, but the squaredance lives on.
1436/Mae/i wonder if Lori knows how to squaredance.
1437/Mae/we should teach her?
1438/Bea/oh, am i being drafted into this makeshift sisterhood?
1439/Mae/sisterhood of squaredancing monsters
1440/Bea/we’ll rule the floor at the state farm show
1441/Mae/we’ll rule any floor we lay our eyes on.
1442/Mae/so i went to Germ’s house.
1443/Bea/WHAT?!
1444/Bea/oh my god tell me about it
1445/Bea/i can’t believe he even has a house.
1446/Mae/oh yeah, he does. He’s from somewhere.
1447/Mae/uh it’s a big double-wide with a built-on basement and a deck
1448/Mae/really nice, actually.
1449/Mae/he’s got a trampoline.
1450/Bea/oof. bouncing on those always makes me sick.
1451/Mae/anyway his grandma lives there
1452/Mae/she told my fortune. sorta.
1453/Bea/holy shit.
1454/Bea/what was your fortune?
1455/Mae/well she said some pretty shitty things about my whole
1456/Mae/you know. head thing.
1457/Bea/ah.
1458/Mae/but otherwise it was kinda vaguely... what happened last night?
1459/Bea/wow. spooky.
1460/Bea/you know, if you go back in regional history and stuff
1461/Bea/there’s like stories about witches and stuff
1462/Mae/you believe in witches?
1463/Bea/oh geez don’t ask me what i believe in today
1464/Bea/but yeah. It’s in the history books.
1465/Mae/so you’re telling me she was actually psychic
1466/Bea/how would that even work?
1467/Bea/does that mean the future is just set?
1468/Mae/maybe it’s the future depending on what choices we make
1469/Bea/but if the choices haven’t been made yet that’s part of the future
1470/Bea/so it should be part of the… something...
1471/Bea/uuuugh. My brain.
1472/Mae/no, that’s a good point. Didn’t think about that.
1473/Mae/well anyway. What she said was scary but
1474/Mae/it was nice to feel like there was some sort of order to all of this.
1475/Mae/like when i picked out dinner the other night
1476/Mae/was that like the only dinner i could have picked?
1477/Mae/were we like, destined to get trapped in Mrs. miranda’s basement?
1478/Bea/god, i hope not.
1479/Not Stated/yeah
1480/Bea/thinking that the future is just like an equation playing out
1481/Bea/it’s really claustrophobic, right?
1482/Mae/yeah.
1483/Not Stated/why not?
1484/Bea/i don’t want my mom to have to have died.
1485/Bea/i don’t want me to have to have missed college.
1486/Bea/i don’t want the Pickaxe to be some hard-coded destiny.
1487/Mae/hm. Yeah.
1488/Mae/eff that noise.
1489/Bea/eff it right into the stratosphere.
1490/Mae/remember that story… uh… adina and the frozen lake?
1491/Bea/isn’t it Adina and The Forest God?
1492/Mae/ok whatever.
1493/Mae/there were these weird teens
1494/Bea/i don’t remember that part of the story
1495/Mae/no dummy, this part actually happened
1496/Bea/i know. I was joking.
1497/Mae/i don’t know how to interpret jokes today!
1498/Bea/ok so you saw some teens
1499/Mae/anyway they were being all spooky
1500/Mae/actually you met them- in the graveyard
1501/Bea/oh THOSE teens.
1502/Bea/the teens that tortured you
1503/Mae/yeah. Them.
1504/Mae/they told me i’d see some pentagrams, and then it happened?
1505/Mae/i think they’re like witches or something.
1506/Bea/you think they’re... uh... psychic?
1507/Mae/i dunno. I think they’re just weird.
1508/Mae/but i saw the last pentagram when we were down there last night.
1509/Mae/it was like in the tunnel supports where the… hole… was.
1510/Mae/angus would laugh at that
1511/Mae/say i’m just pattern-seeking
1512/Bea/yeah that’s angus. He’d say it nicely though.
1513/Mae/it didn’t really register much with me at the moment
1514/Mae/but like in that story there’s like a dead astronomer or something
1515/Mae/and they’re like a reflection in the ice
1516/Mae/and there’s this star they can’t see until they’re dead
1517/Bea/yeah. The ghost star.
1518/Mae/and if you saw a reflection of the ghost star it’d be like a pentagram.
1519/Bea/that is true.
1520/Mae/i dunno. There’s this other kid, Lori Meyers.
1521/Mae/we were hanging out by the tracks
1522/Bea/so you’re just hanging out with teenagers all over the place.
1523/Mae/oh hush.
1524/Mae/so lori like squishes these little metal dudes on the train tracks
1525/Mae/and they become like these cool little monsters.
1526/Bea/oh that’s cool.
1527/Mae/yeah Lori’s pretty rad.
1528/Mae/but watching her do that, it felt like this… uh… ritual?
1529/Mae/like what was that old magic where they tried to make gold out of shit?
1530/Bea/alchemy.
1531/Mae/yeah. It was like alkamee. She was like doing magic.
1532/Bea/so you’re saying you’ve met like 4 witches.
1533/Mae/not real ones but
1534/Mae/i don’t know what i’m getting at.
1535/Mae/when i felt like everything was over, like there was no hope
1536/Mae/remembering like… ghost stars and adina and teen witches
1537/Mae/and lori making monsters out of toy people and real trains
1538/Mae/just suddenly felt like life was happening
1539/Mae/and teens were doing weird magic.
1540/Mae/so things couldn’t be that hopeless.
1541/Bea/this is like those inspirational stories religious people put in books
1542/Bea/and like old people read them
1543/Bea/about how angels like stopped a car from hitting them
1544/Bea/or sold them a house for almost no money
1545/Bea/except your angels are teen dipshits
1546/Mae/you work with what you have i guess.
1547/Bea/hm.
1548/Mae/you believe in like psychics and shit?
1549/Mae/oh wait sorry we already talked about this.
1550/Bea/when?
1551/Mae/at the graveyard the other night!
1552/Mae/you said you might believe in ghosts and stuff
1553/Bea/“and shit?”
1554/Mae/just like… supernatural shit in general?
1555/Bea/sure yeah i’m open to it. Kinda. whatever.
1556/Mae/remember the weird teens we met there?
1557/Bea/ha ha yeah the ones that like tortured you?
1558/Mae/yeah. Them.
1559/Mae/i met them before.
1560/Mae/so i met these three weird teens
1561/Mae/out by the watertower
1562/Mae/they were all spooky and shit
1563/Mae/they said i’d like see some pentagrams and i’d get like some sort of help.
1564/Mae/i think they’re witches.
1565/Bea/that’s weird and friendly.
1566/Mae/ok, hold that thought- the other day I went to Germ’s house, and-
1567/Bea/HOLY SHIT!!!
1568/Bea/you want to GERM’S HOUSE?!?!?
1569/Bea/what’s it like?
1570/Mae/it’s nice. It’s like a doublewide with a finished basement.
1571/Mae/got a trampoline.
1572/Bea/oof. bouncing on those always makes me sick.
1573/Mae/i effin loved it dude.
1574/Mae/i bounced so high and talked about like unions with his dad and uncle
1575/Bea/this all sounds amazing.
1576/Mae/anyway his grandma told my fortune. sorta.
1577/Bea/holy shit.
1578/Bea/what was your fortune?
1579/Mae/well she said some pretty shitty things about my whole
1580/Mae/you know. head thing.

1583/Bea/wow.
1584/Mae/yeah.
1585/Mae/when I was down there last night,
1586/Mae/i saw the last of the pentagrams.
1587/Mae/it was in the support beams
1588/Mae/Angus would laugh if I told him
1589/Mae/he’d talk about how i’m just pattern-seeking.
1590/Bea/yeah that sounds like Angus.
1591/Mae/when i saw it i didn’t like really register it until today
1592/Mae/and it was like whoa
1593/Mae/the teens were right
1594/Mae/germ’s grandma was... a quarter right? something like that?
1595/Bea/was what they said helpful?
1596/Mae/yeah... i felt like i like wasn’t alone in this
1597/Mae/i mean you were all there
1598/Mae/but this was help like... inside my head
1599/Mae/like the fact that someone knew about all of this
1600/Mae/and were trying to help me
1601/Mae/like they’re *all* witches
1602/Mae/and like... i don’t believe in magic really but… i dunno
1603/Bea/sounds like you believe in magic

1616/Bea/like in a treehouse somewhere?
1617/Mae/nah, it’s nice.
1618/Mae/it’s like a double-wide with a built on basement
1619/Mae/got a trampoline
1620/Bea/oof. I get pukey on those.
1621/Mae/it was awesome. We ate sloppy joes.
1622/Bea/mmmm. I could go for one of those right about now.
1623/Mae/god, they’re so good.
1624/Mae/like you forget about them until you hear someone mention it
1625/Mae/and suddenly that’s all you want.
1626/Mae/shoulda just made those for dinner at your place the other night
1627/Bea/ooooh yeah
1628/Bea/hey sorry again about yelling at you.
1629/Mae/oh don’t worry i already forgot that entire conversation.
1630/Bea/oh.
1631/Mae/anyway, before all that
1632/Mae/his grandma told my fortune. sorta.
1633/Bea/holy shit.
1634/Bea/what was your fortune?
1635/Mae/well she said some pretty shitty things about my whole
1636/Mae/you know. head thing.
1637/Bea/ah.
1638/Mae/but otherwise it was kinda vaguely... what happened last night?
1639/Bea/wow.
1640/Mae/but it wasn’t so much what she said, but more like, who she was
1641/Bea/who was she?
1642/Mae/just an old lady getting involved in all this weirdness. For some reason.
1643/Bea/uh huh.
1644/Mae/ok so also there’s this kid, Lori, that I’ve been hanging out with?
1645/Bea/“kid”?
1646/Mae/like 15 or something.
1647/Bea/so you’re just hanging with children and the elderly these days?
1648/Mae/anyway.
1649/Mae/Lori lives over by the tracks
1650/Mae/and i don’t think her home life is great.
1651/Mae/at all.
1652/Mae/but she’s awesome. Loves horror movies.
1653/Mae/makes these little monsters by putting little metal dudes on the tracks
1654/Bea/oh and they get all squished and stretched? That’s rad.
1655/Mae/yeah see? Cool kid.
1656/Mae/then she’ll take like two of them and squash ‘em together.
1657/Bea/doublemonster.
1658/Mae/i feel like i’m kind of an older sister to her when we hang out?
1659/Mae/My grandma died a while back
1660/Mae/and germ’s grandma was trying to grandma me.
1661/Mae/and you’re like my... sister? Cousin?
1662/Bea/the crazy uncle.
1663/Mae/ok whatever.
1664/Mae/point being: we’re all stuck together like Lori’s squashed monster guys
1665/Mae/like you and me and like Germ’s grandma and lori and
1666/Bea/gonna add like Mrs. Miranda in there?
1667/Mae/no. she makes mummies. That’s not allowed.
1668/Bea/so we’re all part of… something?
1669/Mae/we’re all a part of the same squashed monster.
1670/Bea/deep.
1671/Mae/the world is extremely messed up, huh?
1672/Bea/yes. Yes it is.
1673/Mae/a… failed state?
1674/Bea/getting pretty close.
1675/Mae/my granddad, before he died
1676/Mae/his last words were like “This house is haunted”
1677/Bea/ok that’s spooky. Was he in your house?
1678/Mae/no, he was like looking out the window at the hospital.
1679/Mae/but i think i get what he meant.
1680/Mae/this whole… place.
1681/Mae/the other day I ran into these three weird teens
1682/Mae/actually wait you met them too
1683/Mae/at the graveyard.
1684/Bea/ha ha ha yeah. The ones that tortured you.
1685/Mae/yeah them.
1686/Mae/they told me i’d see a bunch of pentagrams and it’d like “aid” me
1687/Mae/i think they’re witches.
1688/Mae/and then it actually happened?
1689/Bea/how… so?
1690/Mae/i dunno. I saw the last of them in the tunnel last night.
1691/Mae/made from like the support beams.
1692/Mae/Angus would say it was pattern-seeking
1693/Bea/that sounds like angus. He’d say it nicely though.
1694/Mae/when i saw it it reminded me of something
1695/Mae/didn’t really register until this morning-
1696/Mae/remember Adina and the Frozen lake?
1697/Bea/the folk tale? I think it’s called Adina and the Forest God.
1698/Mae/whatever. Remember how there was like a dead astronomer
1699/Mae/who was like a reflection in the ice?
1700/Bea/yeah. Uh. looking for a star you could only see when you’re dead.
1701/Bea/the Ghost Star.
1702/Bea/my mom had a ghost star tattoo.
1703/Mae/anyway, like if you’re looking at a reflection of a star from below
1704/Mae/it’s gonna look kinda like a pentagram
1705/Bea/that’s… true?
1706/Mae/woke up this morning and was like oh wow
1707/Mae/i feel like i  found my ghost star
1708/Mae/and then lived.
1709/Bea/and this is because of teen witches?
1710/Mae/ok see i thought that was dumb BUT
1711/Mae/I met Germ’s grandma.
1712/Bea/WHAT?????
1713/Mae/yeah I went to his house!
1714/Bea/What’s it like????
1715/Mae/um it’s nice?
1716/Mae/double wide with a finished basement.
1717/Mae/got a trampoline.
1718/Bea/ugh. bouncing on those things makes me sick.
1719/Mae/anyway his grandma told my fortune. sorta.
1720/Bea/holy shit.
1721/Bea/what was your fortune?
1722/Mae/well she said some pretty shitty things about my whole
1723/Mae/you know. head thing.
1724/Bea/ah.
1725/Mae/but otherwise it was kinda vaguely... what happened last night?
1726/Bea/wow.
1727/Mae/yeah see? So like I’m thinking, maybe *she’s* a witch too.
1728/Mae/not like an actual witch. The teens aren’t *real* witches either.
1729/Bea/so...
1730/Mae/there’s this other kid, Lori M. we’ve been hanging out.
1731/Bea/you just hanging with teens all over the place these days?
1732/Mae/hush. I’m like a role model.
1733/Bea/oh well then.
1734/Mae/Lori does this thing where she puts little metal dudes on the train tracks.
1735/Bea/oooh! And the train squishes them? That’s so cool.
1736/Mae/yeah she’s great.
1737/Mae/i dunno. Maybe this is just me not being a kid anymore
1738/Mae/but watching her do that. Open her little bag
1739/Mae/and pull out these things
1740/Mae/and then like using actual trains
1741/Mae/making little monsters.
1742/Mae/i came to the only logical conclusion.
1743/Mae/Witch.
1744/Bea/Well gee Mae you seem to be just swimming in witches.
1745/Mae/Hey listen you could be one too.
1746/Bea/oh god i wish. I have some hexes to hand out.
1747/Mae/and I mean obviously i count as a witch. I’m like spooky magic all the way.
1748/Bea/of course
1749/Mae/i dunno. Last night, today…
1750/Mae/everything is extremely bad here right now.
1751/Mae/everything is bad in the world.
1752/Bea/guys last night,
1753/Bea/they’re like ghosts in an old mansion
1754/Bea/don’t know they’re dead
1755/Bea/just stalking around killing whoever moves in.
1756/Mae/like granddad said. It’s haunted.
1757/Mae/but there’s also a lot of witches in it.
1758/Mae/and that makes me feel a tiny bit better.
1759/Bea/so the entire rust belt is just lousy with ghosts and witches?
1760/Mae/yeah but not all ghosts are bad, like… i mean… ugh.
1761/Mae/I don’t really know where I’m going with this. It’s been a long week.
1762/Bea/it’s fine.
1763/Mae/so,
1764/Mae/have you had any new… uh… rat problems at the shop?
1765/Bea/uh… yeah. How did you know?
1766/Mae/I heard there were some rats around town.
1767/Mae/makes me happy for some reason.
1768/Bea/well there’s no such thing as a small rat problem
1769/Bea/there’s just gonna be more of them
1770/Mae/Hope springs. Rats Multiply.
1771/Bea/cute. we literally sell rat poison.
1772/Bea/they’re going down
1773/Mae/we’ll see.
1774/Mae/hey, speaking of nothing,
1775/Mae/how good is your car?
1776/Bea/good how?
1777/Mae/like, can it drive real far?
1778/Bea/Mae do you know anything ab-… what?
1779/Mae/we should like do a roooooad trip.
1780/Bea/to where?
1781/Mae/out west
1782/Mae/it gets all flat
1783/Bea/that it does.
1784/Mae/we can go where it’s really flat
1785/Not Stated/and they sell barbeque.
1786/Bea/i think BBQ is south
1787/Mae/not all of it
1788/Mae/it’s everywhere, Bea-Bea-Q.
1789/Mae/all different kinds. Dry. Wet. Ultra.
1790/Not Stated/and you can see like the world’s largest pierogi.
1791/Mae/or a museum of toy rocket ships
1792/Mae/or a factory where they make pretzels
1793/Mae/or a house that looks like a big chicken!
1794/Bea/i could… ok let’s talk about it next year
1795/Mae/i’ll start planning it now.
1796/Bea/i thought you couldn’t leave home because of your… issue?
1797/Mae/eh. You’re home enough.
1798/Mae/i mean if we’re trapped here together
1799/Mae/we might as well be trapped out there together.
1800/Mae/i mean if we’re not dead by then. L O L.
1801/Bea/you have a way of making doom sound like a lot of fun, maeday.
1802/Bea/that is actually kind of a gift.
1803/Gregg/GODDAMN THIS DOOR!
1804/Angus/I think god already has.
1805/Mae/there they are!
1806/Angus/hey guys.
1807/Gregg/sup nerds.
1808/Not Stated/pssh. It’s you who are the nerds.
1809/Gregg/whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
1810/Angus/geez. We’ve never been so insulted.
1811/Gregg/take it right back, dork.
1812/Mae/fat chance.
1813/Not Stated/how did you get Angus out of work?
1814/Gregg/i made up a family emergency.
1815/Angus/my uncle got run over by a tractor.
1816/Mae/ha ha wow.
1817/Angus/i mean he did in real life too but that was years ago.
1818/Bea/hey gregg, so…
1819/Bea/i didn’t really know Casey.
1820/Gregg/…
1821/Gregg/yeah.
1822/Bea/I just wanted to say I’m really sorry.
1823/Gregg/yeah.
1824/Gregg/thanks.
1825/Gregg/Casey was a good one.
1826/Mae/Casey was good.
1827/Bea/should we like… tell his parents?
1828/Not Stated/probably?
1829/Angus/what do we tell them?
1830/Mae/i dunno.
1831/Mae/can we like… make up something that sounds real?
1832/Bea/oh what, the truth isn’t real enough?
1833/Bea/no you’re right the truth is insane
1834/Not Stated/no????
1835/Mae/i mean, tell them what?
1836/Bea/uh. Ok yeah.
1837/Bea/hm
1838/Bea/good point.
1839/Angus/so like, what do we do?
1840/Mae/about Casey?
1841/Angus/no, like, in general
1842/Mae/can we think about this tomorrow?
1843/Mae/can we just play a song and get a pizza?
1844/Bea/i don’t think “song and pizza” is an answer, really.
1845/Mae/can we just be normal for like one day?
1846/Bea/i don’t know how today can possibly feel normal.
1847/Not Stated/when i was in that coma or whatever
1848/Mae/i saw the future
1849/Mae/or maybe it’s now the future
1850/Mae/or was the future
1851/Angus/like flying cars and shit?
1852/Angus/actually those would be a disaster
1853/Gregg/ha ha FINALLY you admit it. You owe me 5 bucks.
1854/Angus/bet’s a bet.
1855/Mae/no, it was like the town was abandoned
1856/Mae/like being eaten and reclaimed by nature or some shit
1857/Mae/i went to where my house used to be
1858/Mae/when i was there i felt completely hopeless
1859/Mae/but now i think i could just build another house.
1860/Mae/or i could just move on.
1861/Mae/knowing when to hold on
1862/Mae/and when to let go
1863/Mae/…
1864/Mae/ok i lost my entire train of thought.
1865/Mae/i had it for a second.
1866/Mae/then it was gone.
1867/Bea/song and pizza sounds good, mae.
1868/Gregg/song and pizza.
1869/Mae/yeah.
1870/Mae/good enough.
1871/Not Stated/when i was down there last night
1872/Mae/i like made the decision not to die
1873/Mae/or at least not to die without a fight
1874/Mae/and the… thing down there…
1875/Mae/told me nothing would save me forever
1876/Bea/wait, it was like, talking to you?
1877/Mae/it’s been talking to me for a long time.
1878/Mae/i just didn’t know what it was.
1879/Mae/but anyway like nothing is gonna save us forever
1880/Mae/but a lot of things can save us today.
1881/Angus/that’s really pretty, mae.
1882/Mae/ha ha thanks i totally made it up
1883/Mae/like right on the spot last night
1884/Bea/i said it before. You’re good with doom.
1885/Gregg/doom doom doom
1886/Mae/so anyway. Song and pizza.
1887/Mae/we earned it by still being alive for another day
1888/Bea/that’s a decent reason.
1889/Gregg/decent.
1890/Angus/decent.
1891/Mae/decent.
1892/Mae/...and anyway i don't even know if they're dreams or not.
1893/Mae/and this guy, who i think was a ghost
1894/Mae/kidnapped some kid and also i think was in my head after

1897/Mae/because this is scary.
1898/Bea/well that's not what i was expecting to hear tonight.
1899/Gregg/are you ok, dude?
1900/Not Stated/yeah!
1901/Mae/i'm not like losing it or something.
1902/Not Stated/no!

1914/Mae/if there's like
1915/Mae/some ghosty stuff happening around here?
1916/Mae/like, from a source we can trust.
1917/Angus/such as...
1918/Mae/does the newspaper have like a ghost section?
1919/Mae/What? Why is that a dumb question?
1920/Bea/you know, we could go check the Library.
1921/Mae/for... books? about it?
1922/Bea/no, they have the local paper on file
1923/Bea/going back a century.
1924/Bea/if there's some secret history of kidnapper ghosts
1925/Bea/we'll find it there probably.
1926/Mae/oh wow! i didn't know they had that!
1927/Mae/i thought it was just like a broken down old bunch of books?
1928/Bea/when's the last time you were at the library?
1929/Bea/we actually have one of the nicer ones around.
1930/Mae/oh. how?

2050/BeaDad/Yep, but we’ll live I think!
2051/BeaDad/HA HA HA!!
2052/BeaDad/I don't think the fish worked out.
2053/Mae/I thought hey fish is ok, Bakey Shakey is good...
2054/BeaDad/I think Bakey Shakey needs something... else.
2055/Mae/I thought like... uh... two good things...
2056/Mae/probably make one really good thing?
2057/BeaDad/I don't think ground beef was meant to stand alone.
2058/Bea/Like, in a pile.
2059/Mae/Awwwwww...
2060/BeaDad/I think I might actually be a little ill.
2061/Mae/I thought like... fish is good! Chicken is good!
2062/Bea/Not like this. Not like this.
2063/Mae/No. Ok.
2064/Mae/If you go to Admiral Fry's and order the number 7.
2065/Mae/IT'S CHICKEN AND FISH!
2066/Bea/Yeah but they're separate. And fried.

2069/Bea/with the Bakey Shakey.
2070/Mae/Chicken and cream of chicken!
2071/Mae/Creamy chicken!
2072/Bea/and you're thinking hey
2073/Bea/how do I improve this.
2074/Mae/Yeah see you get it.
2075/BeaDad/I don't think pork and chicken were supposed to meet this way.
2076/Mae/Aw, really?
2077/BeaDad/I don't think creamy beef and chicken soup
2078/BeaDad/is gonna win you any blue ribbons at the fair.
2079/Mae/Oh come on I GUARANTEE this is an actual recipe.
2080/Mae/Am I just bad at everything?
2081/Bea/No, just fixing things and planning meals.
2082/Mae/Those are big life skills!
2083/Bea/Did you like it?

2126/Bea/I thought they had a shoe shop?
2127/BeaDad/Eh, details.
2128/BeaDad/MMM. Bakey chicken n' rice n' taters.
2129/Mae/It's a classic for a reason.
2130/Bea/Oh we're familiar with it.
2131/Mae/I never promised to cook exotic!
2132/BeaDad/Fish and Mac and spinach.
2133/BeaDad/What they used to serve at the local parish when I was a boy.
2134/BeaDad/During whatever holiday where you're supposed to eat fish.
2135/Mae/Is that a thing?
2136/Bea/It's a thing.
2137/BeaDad/She should pick out our meals every night!
2138/Bea/No dad we’d die of some sort of sugar shock.
2139/Mae/Not true!
2140/Not Stated/I also do burgers and tacos and pizza!
2141/Bea/Well then we’d just die of that.
2142/BeaDad/Worse ways.
2143/Not Stated/I know how to cook rice and hamburger casserole!
2144/BeaDad/Bea’s mother used to make that.
2145/Bea/Ha ha you said that to me.
2146/BeaDad/Ok, Mae: Bea’s mother used to make that.
2147/Bea/And even she learned we can’t eat that every night.
2148/BeaDad/Not after that week at Horker’s Gorge.
2149/Not Stated/I know how to scramble eggs and cook those biscuits from a tube!
2150/BeaDad/I like sausages.
2151/Bea/Can’t eat breakfast for every meal.
2152/Mae/I can do a salad!
2153/Bea/Hallelujah.
2154/BeaDad/Heh heh Mae, you’re alright!
2155/BeaDad/HA HA HA HA HA!!!
2156/Bea/This definitely turned out better than whatever it is you made in that basement last night.
2157/BeaDad/What?
2158/Bea/Nothing.
2159/Mae/Thanks. I’m pretty great.
2160/MaeLaptop/None of us asked for any of this.
2161/MaeLaptop/and it didn't happen to us because we're like special.
2162/MaeLaptop/You can work as hard as you want but
2163/MaeLaptop/the universe is gonna keep doing what it does.
2164/MaeLaptop/and i don't think any of us deserved all this.

2853/Mae/and i followed her out into the hallway
2854/Mae/and i don't know why but i shouted
2855/Mae/HEY!
2856/Mae/and she turned around and and and
2857/Mae/all i could do was wave????
2858/Bea/ooof.
2859/Britt/this is funny.
2860/Mae/and and and
2861/Mae/and then i turned around and tried to walk away all cool
2862/Mae/but i ran into this doorframe right behind me
2863/Mae/and it hurt and i staggered back and and and
2864/Mae/fell into the trash can outside the cafeteria
2865/Mae/and my face went into trash spaghetti
2866/Bea/holy shit dude.
2867/Britt/CONTINUE!
2868/Mae/and i like flailed until the trash tipped over...
2869/Mae/and i got up and the girl had had had...
2870/Mae/she'd watched all of it...
2871/Mae/and i tried to give her this smile like
2872/Mae/i'd somehow meant to do that
2873/Mae/but it turns out i'd swallowed some of the trash
2874/Mae/spaghetti
2875/Mae/and and and
2876/Mae/I puked all over myself!!!

2901/Mae/yeah?
2902/Bea/So you know how you said you’ve been seeing ghosts at night?
2903/Bea/I mean I don’t super believe it's not just dreams.
2904/Bea/because obviously it's dreams.
2905/Mae/ok that's certainly your take on it.
2906/Bea/but like...
2907/Bea/did you ever see my mom?
2908/Not Stated/yes
2909/Mae/it's hard to like recognize anyone
2910/Mae/but you can get a sense of people
2911/Mae/and i uh i'm pretty sure i saw her
2912/Bea/...
2913/Bea/really?
2914/Mae/as far as i can tell.
2915/Bea/I just... want to know she's somewhere
2916/Bea/and ok.
2917/Mae/she's somewhere, bea. and ok.
2918/Bea/thanks. i don't know if you're just lying
2919/Bea/or you dreamed it

2922/Bea/it was nice of you.
2923/Not Stated/no
2924/Mae/i mean, i can't really tell?
2925/Mae/and i don't think the ghosts were like
2926/Mae/people?
2927/Mae/like they're not sitting around being ghosts.
2928/Mae/it's more like
2929/Mae/echoes?
2930/Mae/echoes of shit that happened and people that were here?
2931/Bea/...
2932/Bea/oh.
2933/Mae/trust me, none of the places looked like super much fun.

2937/Bea/i appreciate you trying to turn this around.
2938/Mae/i'm doing my best, beatrice.
2939/Bea/alright anyway
2940/Bea/so the bad news is that we're locked out.

3327/MichelleCzajkowski/“The wise kitten focuses not on that which is lost but on all that remains.”
3328/Mae/ok wow
3329/Mae/you just hanging out in the back of the party
3330/Mae/dishing out wisdom?
3331/Mae/alright well I’ll keep that in mind!
3332/Mae/have a good one!
3333/Mae/Did you guys just move in?
3334/Bea/10 months ago.
3335/Mae/Why aren’t you unpacked?
3336/Not Stated/Pretty cool record player.
3337/Mae/e_ĝoja
3338/Mae/as far as record players go.
3339/Bea/It was my mom’s.
3340/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
3341/Mae/I don’t have any records.
3342/Mae/I don’t get records.
3343/Bea/My mom was into them.
3344/Bea/Ha ha. They were retro when she was a my age.
3345/Mae/They’re retro now.
3346/Bea/That’s how retro works.
3347/Not Stated/Your old room was like...
3348/Bea/Bigger?
3349/Mae/Messy. Really messy.
3350/Bea/Eh. I was a slob when I was a kid.
3351/Mae/Guess the boxes take care of that problem.
3352/Bea/No, mom yelled it out of me.
3353/Mae/e_ĝoja
3354/Mae/MOMS, amirite?
3355/Bea/U are rite.
3356/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
3357/Mae/So I’ve got a question.
3358/Bea/Mmhmm.
3359/Not Stated/What exactly does your dad *DO* at the store?
3360/Bea/These days? Not much.
3361/Bea/Uh. Some administrative stuff.
3362/Bea/He hires the repair guys...
3363/Bea/He sometimes goes out on jobs.
3364/Bea/That’s kind of his whole area.
3365/Bea/But that's about it.
3366/Not Stated/Your dad’s kinda up and down, huh?
3367/Bea/He has good days and bad days.
3368/Bea/Often in the same day.
3369/Mae/ha ha. Gregg's always been like that too.
3370/Mae/just more... uh... zany about it.
3371/Bea/well Gregg is probably bipolar
3372/Mae/gee thanks, doctor bea.
3373/Bea/whereas my dad is having a years-long breakdown.
3374/Mae/You run the whole store now, right?
3375/Bea/More or less.
3376/Mae/Yeah but it’s still his name on everything.
3377/Bea/Yep.
3378/Mae/And meanwhile you’re running basically everything.
3379/Bea/Yep.
3380/Bea/And! And! working there every day too.
3381/Bea/Yep.
3382/Mae/I just think you shouldn’t.
3383/Bea/Ok.
3384/Not Stated/I just think you're like selling yourself out.
3385/Bea/I’m sorry, what?
3386/Not Stated/I would probably just quit.
3387/Mae/or like, take over the store.
3388/Mae/Like, you not doing anything about it just reinforces-
3389/Bea/Is this really the road you want to go down with this?
3390/Not Stated/I’m saying you should stand up for yourself or just like... quit!
3391/Bea/"Quit"?
3392/Bea/Really? Just quit.
3393/Bea/You are seriously detached from reality.
3394/Not Stated/I’m saying it’s not right that you just roll over and take it.
3395/Bea/"Take it?"
3396/Bea/"TAKE IT"?!?!?!
3397/Mae/You’re doing all the work and he’s getting all the credit!
3398/Bea/oh go to hell.
3399/Mae/e_malĝoja
3400/Not Stated/WHAT?!
3401/Bea/you heard me.
3402/Not Stated/WHY?!
3403/Bea/RAAAAAAGH.
3404/Mae/what is your problem?
3405/Bea/here's some reality for you:
3406/Bea/You know Creek? Repair Guy Creek at the shop?
3407/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
3408/Not Stated/No?
3409/Bea/You’ve seen him.
3410/Bea/Talks a lot. Worked for us since forever.
3411/Not Stated/...yeah?
3412/Bea/yeah you met him when we were kids.
3413/Bea/When I was 15 he asked my dad if he could teach me how to drive.
3414/Bea/And my dad said no, and then told me not to be alone with him.
3415/Not Stated/What the?
3416/Bea/Yeah. Exactly.
3417/Not Stated/I don't follow.
3418/Bea/he's a creep, Mae.
3419/Bea/And you know what? HE still works for us.
3420/Mae/e_malĝoja
3421/Mae/!!!
3422/Mae/Why haven’t you fired him?!?!
3423/Bea/I can't fire people!
3424/Bea/And even if I could, he’s on the crew.
3425/Bea/And frankly he’s our best guy. Practically heads up the repair team.
3426/Bea/Since my dad’s barely doing anything!
3427/Bea/And Creek’s got a family. And he needs the work.
3428/Not Stated/That’s disgusting!
3429/Mae/e_brakoj_supren_gaje
3430/Mae/It’s not your responsibility to-
3431/Bea/I KNOW!
3432/Bea/DON’T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?!
3433/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
3434/Not Stated/I’m gonna be sick.
3435/Bea/YEAH! ME TOO!
3436/Bea/I’M REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT FEELING.
3437/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
3438/Mae/I’m just saying if you keep letting these dudes off the hook-
3439/Bea/OFF THE HOOK?!
3440/Mae/Like, you're stronger than this, Bea.
3441/Mae/You're like... badass and shit.
3442/Bea/Y-YOU...
3443/Bea/"BADASS?"
3444/Bea/MY MOM DYING WAS NOT VERY "BADASS."
3445/Bea/ME SITTING IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW IS NOT VERY "BADASS."
3446/Mae/ok sorry, i-
3447/Bea/You are such a shithead, you know that?
3448/Mae/e_malĝoja
3449/Not Stated/Aaaaargh!
3450/Bea/"Aaaaargh?" "Aaaaargh" what?!
3451/Not Stated/What the hell?
3452/Bea/"uuughhuhuhg what the hell?!"
3453/Bea/A lot of time folks can’t just "choose" to do
3454/Bea/whatever it is you decree to be the right thing!
3455/Bea/A lot of times people do the things they do
3456/Bea/because they can’t do anything else!
3457/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
3458/Not Stated/You ALWAYS have a choice.
3459/Bea/says the child-woman with no job
3460/Bea/no rent
3461/Bea/no responsibilities
3462/Bea/and no consequences for your stupid actions
3463/Not Stated/You can ALWAYS choose.
3464/Bea/choose what?
3465/Bea/honestly. tell me.
3466/Bea/what is my choice here?
3467/Not Stated/you can just leave! i dunno!
3468/Bea/I... I...
3469/Bea/y-you
3470/Not Stated/tell your dad you're not gonna take this!
3471/Bea/tell him what????
3472/Bea/what is your magic solution
3473/Bea/that *I* need to do
3474/Bea/I am seriously going to punch your goddamn lights out.
3475/Mae/e_malĝoja
3476/Bea/You come in here and start telling me how *I’M* screwing things up?
3477/Bea/You want to come in here and say
3478/Bea/“oh yeah just ditch your dad,
3479/Bea/who is both getting old
3480/Bea/AND can barely get off the couch half the time?”
3481/Bea/Oh, but "good dinner", Mae!
3482/Bea/You want to come in here and say
3483/Bea/"oh yeah just start this big drama
3484/Bea/and make your life WAY more stressful?"
3485/Not Stated/It’s just not right is what I’m saying!
3486/Bea/Yeah. It isn’t. Nothing’s right.
3487/Bea/The whole effing world isn’t right.
3488/Not Stated/That is NOT what I’m saying!
3489/Bea/Oh, what are you saying, then?
3490/Mae/AAAARGH I don’t know anymore!
3491/Bea/like gregg is probably off doing god knows what wacky shit right now
3492/Bea/i'm here making dinner and doing payroll.
3493/Bea/You know like *nothing* about my life.
3494/Bea/You just know what I “should” do.
3495/Bea/And you’re the last person I’d ask for advice.
3496/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
3497/Mae/Ok ok I’m sorry.
3498/Bea/Yeah, you’re sorry. Everyone's sorry.
3499/Bea/But you don’t get it.
3500/Mae/I thought we were having fun!
3501/Mae/We went to the mall! We got stuck in a basement!
3502/Bea/Yeah and that was ALL you did those days.
3503/Bea/I’d worked a good 6 hours before you even woke up probably
3504/Bea/and came home each night after you and I were done
3505/Bea/to pay bills and figure out how we’re making next payroll
3506/Bea/While dad slept on the couch.
3507/Bea/This isn’t fun.
3508/Bea/You’re just like the other night, but all the time.
3509/Bea/Running around messing with people and taking whatever you want.
3510/Bea/While the whole mall is falling apart around you.
3511/Mae/I thought you had a good time!
3512/Bea/...
3513/Bea/It’s like last night
3514/Bea/you get to play around in garbage and break shit and everything works out.
3515/Bea/While I’m stuck in the corner fixing the furnace.
3516/Mae/But I helped!
3517/Bea/...
3518/Mae/I should go.
3519/Bea/You should go.
3520/Jackie/WHAT DID YOU DO?
3521/Mae/I was gonna ask the same thing!!
3522/Jackie/HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU MESS THAT UP!
3523/Mae/e_malĝoja
3524/Jackie/SHE NEEDS THIS
3525/Jackie/Now she’s god knows where!
3526/Jackie/If something happens to her...
3527/Jackie/I will personally punch your teeth out.
3528/Mae/Ok! Geez!
3529/Jackie/Alright, I’m gonna go up the street.
3530/Jackie/you go down towards the river.
3531/Jackie/We find her, make sure she’s ok, and meet back here.
3532/Mae/Ok! Oh god. Ok.
3533/Jackie/Back in school, I always told Bea that you were an asshole
3534/Jackie/And I really thought that was true.
3535/Jackie/And it’s good to know I was right.
3536/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
3537/Mae/ok ok ok.
3538/Mae/where are you, Bea?
3539/Mae/the roofs. Can get to the river quick on the roofs.
3540/Mae/BEA!
3541/Mae/there you are!
3542/Mae/Are you alright?
3543/Mae/Why did you run?
3544/Mae/That’s like extremely dangerous!
3545/Mae/You’re alone in some college town
3546/Mae/and you don’t even know wh-
3547/Bea/This was my party
3548/Bea/These are my parties
3549/Bea/I come to these
3550/Bea/so I can feel normal
3551/Bea/for like 2 hours a month
3552/Not Stated/*THIS* is normal?
3553/Mae/this is a bunch of dorks in a basement!
3554/Not Stated/You could have been like mugged or something!
3555/Mae/all over some idiot guy??
3556/Mae/college is stupid anyway
3557/Bea/OH MY GOD YOU COMPLETE ASSHOLE
3558/Bea/You will never understand this.
3559/Bea/ever.
3560/Bea/You know what I do when I go to sleep?
3561/Bea/ha ha ha. this is so friggin sad.
3562/Bea/I think like obsessively about going to college
3563/Bea/like really really think hard about it
3564/Bea/and if I'm lucky, as I fall asleep
3565/Bea/i dream about it.
3566/Bea/I have to dream about this
3567/Bea/this thing you're so over already
3568/Bea/is like my wildest fantasy.
3569/Not Stated/You *HAVE* a life!
3570/Bea/no, i don't.
3571/Bea/i have obligations.
3572/Bea/i have a routine.
3573/Not Stated/That is so... sad.
3574/Bea/goddamn right it's sad!
3575/Bea/when my mom died
3576/Bea/my life ended too.
3577/Bea/i had to take over the business
3578/Bea/because dad had a complete breakdown
3579/Bea/and the bills from my mom literally dying
3580/Bea/were so bad that we lost the house
3581/Bea/the house I grew up in
3582/Bea/gone.
3583/Bea/some shitty family with their shitty kids live there now
3584/Bea/now we live in an apartment
3585/Bea/as my dad wastes away
3586/Bea/and like any idea i had of the future
3587/Bea/this big, bright thing
3588/Bea/just gets smaller and darker
3589/Bea/every time i wake up
3590/Bea/from a dream about nights like tonight
3591/Bea/and you can't get that
3592/Bea/through your thick effing skull
3593/Not Stated/that's not fair
3594/Bea/none of this is fair!
3595/Bea/nothing is fair!
3596/Not Stated/i had no idea about any of this!
3597/Bea/HOW?!
3598/Bea/HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW THIS?!
3599/Bea/I work hard!
3600/Bea/and i take care of what's left of my family
3601/Bea/and my life is slipping away
3602/Bea/and i'm trapped in that stupid hardware store
3603/Bea/in that stupid town.
3604/Bea/i'm
3605/Bea/just
3606/Bea/doomed.
3607/Mae/you're not the only person stuck here
3608/Mae/you know.
3609/Bea/you gave up the thing i can't have
3610/Bea/i... kinda hate you.
3611/Bea/i can't not hate you for that. a little.
3612/Not Stated/you don't know anything about it.
3613/Bea/what is there to know?
3614/Bea/honestly!
3615/Not Stated/you don't know why i had to leave
3616/Bea/oh i'm sure it's a brilliant reason.
3617/Mae/you just sit there judging me
3618/Mae/have you ever even asked why i left?
3619/Bea/yeah. first day you were back.
3620/Mae/oh.
3621/Mae/right.
3622/Bea/so why did you leave?
3623/Mae/i...
3624/Mae/i don't know.
3625/Mae/my head is in pieces right now
3626/Mae/any answer i could give would sound nuts.
3627/Bea/oh.
3628/Bea/well that's illuminating.
3629/Mae/oh shut up.
3630/Mae/all this shit going on this past week?
3631/Mae/ghosts and shit?
3632/Mae/i met god!
3633/Mae/he was an asshole!
3634/Bea/uh-huh.
3635/Bea/AAAAGH.
3636/Mae/look.
3637/Mae/we're both trapped.
3638/Mae/but we're trapped together.
3639/Bea/...
3640/Mae/better to be trapped with someone else, right?
3641/Bea/...
3642/Mae/listen, i'm sorry.
3643/Mae/about
3644/Mae/like,
3645/Bea/it's ok.
3646/Mae/we're like
3647/Mae/the best available friends.
3648/Bea/ha ha ha.
3649/Bea/oh god.
3650/Mae/what river is this?
3651/Bea/Red Winder.
3652/Bea/all the iron in the water
3653/Bea/turns the rocks orange.
3654/Mae/must be weird for them.
3655/Mae/all the rocks on land get to keep their colors.
3656/Mae/and the river rocks are always looking up at them.
3657/Bea/hm.
3658/Mae/so like
3659/Mae/actual question:
3660/Mae/do you think we’d be friends if we weren’t like
3661/Mae/stuck together in the same town?
3662/Mae/like we were stuck together in girlscouts?
3663/Mae/like... Uh... is this just... what’s the word?
3664/Bea/Proximity?
3665/Mae/yeah
3666/Bea/I don't know.
3667/Bea/I honestly don't.
3668/Bea/My entire life feels like running after something
3669/Bea/that keeps moving away into the distance
3670/Bea/while I stay in the same place.
3671/Bea/...
3672/Bea/And I guess proximity counts for a lot right now.
3673/Mae/hm.
3674/Mae/prox-i-mi-ty.
3675/Mae/stuck in a basement together
3676/Mae/again
3677/Mae/this crazy ol' basement
3678/Mae/we call life, beatrice
3679/Bea/thanks. that's uplifting.
3680/Mae/do you want to go back to the party?
3681/Bea/Nah.
3682/Mae/we can come to another one sometime!
3683/Not Stated/I swear I won’t screw it up!
3684/Bea/well, you've done it once
3685/Bea/so you should know how to not do it again.
3686/Not Stated/I'll learn to talk good
3687/Mae/to whatever guy
3688/Mae/you're obviously trying to get with.
3689/Bea/oh good. thanks.
3690/Mae/Bea, you should have told me about everything.
3691/Bea/I was embarrassed.
3692/Bea/my entire life is embarrassing.
3693/Mae/Bea I am like more embarrassing than you will ever be.
3694/Mae/you are like stronger and smarter than anyone I’ve ever met.
3695/Bea/thanks
3696/Bea/And you’re not as big a total idiot as I act like you are.
3697/Bea/i'm a jerk sometimes. I know that.
3698/Bea/but you're a genuinely... good? person.
3699/Mae/I'll take it.
3700/Mae/you know what the Fort Lucenne fish fountain would say
3701/Bea/what?
3702/Mae/BEATRICE SANTELLO
3703/Mae/WE SHOULD GET BURGERS AND SHAKES ON THE WAY HOME
3704/Bea/oh wow. a revelation from god.
3705/Mae/the good god. the fake one.
3706/Mae/Crap! I didn’t get her info!
3707/Bea/Who?
3708/Mae/THIS SUPER CUTE GIRL I MET AT THE PARTY?!?!?
3709/Mae/We did a secret handshake?
3710/Bea/Is that a... euphemism?
3711/Mae/CRAP.
3712/Mae/yeah. We need to come back.
3713/Bea/Ok, you.
3714/Bea/Let’s go home.
3715/Mae/home again, home again.
3716/Mae/I think I went here once
3717/Mae/in girlscouts
3718/Mae/to see some sort of Longest Night play.
3719/Bea/Yeah. I was there.
3720/Mae/oh yeah. We were kinda stuck together back then.
3721/Not Stated/why'd you start talking to me?
3722/Bea/I was new in town
3723/Bea/and you seemed cool.
3724/Mae/that's it?
3725/Bea/You were smart and fun.
3726/Mae/What am I now.
3727/Bea/...
3728/Bea/ya know. "fun".
3729/Mae/it's like super shitty
3730/Mae/that you keep saying I'm not smart.
3731/Bea/I'm sorry. I'm mostly kidding.
3732/Mae/"mostly"
3733/Mae/you're not smart either!
3734/Bea/i was valedictorian of our class!
3735/Mae/like that means anything in the real world.
3736/Bea/...
3737/Mae/sorry
3738/Bea/sorry
3739/Not Stated/what even was that play?
3740/Bea/Corvin the Thief. Old. Kind of obscure.
3741/Bea/Slick little barn cat
3742/Bea/Lived in the woods
3743/Bea/where no one could find him.
3744/Bea/But then he stole a diamond or something
3745/Bea/from the local king
3746/Bea/and got arrowed to death.
3747/Mae/oh yeah. right.
3748/Bea/yep.
3749/Bea/there's a whole second part
3750/Bea/where he's a ghost
3751/Bea/but they never perform that one.
3752/Mae/poor ghost cat.
3753/Bea/alright, let's go.
3754/Mae/I’m kinda nervous about this.
3755/Mae/stay close, alright?
3756/Bea/Nothing to be scared of down there. Just a party.
3757/Mae/...
3758/Mae/Not too late to throw ourselves into traffic instead.
3759/Bea/HEY JACKIE!
3760/Jackie/Hey BEEEEEE!!!
3761/Jackie/Oh weird. It’s Mae.
3762/Mae/e_brakosvinganta

3765/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
3766/Bea/Yeah, is that ok?
3767/Jackie/Sure! It’ll be fun.
3768/Jackie/Come on in! It's a good one.
3769/Mae/is there like dancing and stuff?
3770/Jackie/the world is ending, mae
3771/Jackie/of *course* there's dancing.
3772/Bea/cool
3773/Mae/ok
3774/Mae/Hey! Move!
3775/CarGirl/What?
3776/Mae/Move it, goth dorks.
3777/CarDude/No.
3778/Mae/I NEED TO GET UP ON THE ROOF.
3779/CarDude/You are not jumping on my car.
3780/Mae/I WILL END YOU RIGHT HERE IN THIS PIZZA PLACE PARKING LOT

3822/SteveScriggins/I'm genuinely menacing today.
3823/Mae/Ok I'm actually leaving now.
3824/Mae/I thought your brother did demolition?
3825/SteveScriggins/Yeah, he has his own crew.
3826/Mae/Then why are you doing this?
3827/SteveScriggins/He's got his job, I got mine.
3828/Mae/This is your job?
3829/SteveScriggins/Oh my god shut up.
3830/Mae/This place used to be a thing, huh?
3831/Sadie/Yeah definitely. A total thing.
3832/Mae/Wow.
3833/Sadie/That band from astral mode, they were the house band
3834/Sadie/back a very long time ago.
3835/Mae/Huh.
3836/Sadie/They all went a little nuts by the end.
3837/Sadie/Place closed down in the 80s.
3838/Sadie/They talked about reopening it for a long time
3839/Sadie/but now that the owner's gone wherever he went
3840/Sadie/whole place is just sitting here
3841/Sadie/being the largest birdhouse in Possum Springs.
3842/Mae/So you play (insert instrument)?
3843/Sadie/I sure do.
3844/Mae/Why here?
3845/Sadie/Been coming here since I was 14, around your age.
3846/Mae/I'M 20!!!!
3847/Sadie/Oh. Ok.
3848/Sadie/Then (life experiences that seemed like the end of everything)
3849/Sadie/and I started coming back after work.
3850/Mae/That's depressing.
3851/Sadie/No, it's not.
3852/Mae/Oh. It’s Steve.

3922/Mae/and now, years later, you're what-
3923/Mae/ripping apart buildings for scrap?
3924/Mae/like, actively destroying the town?
3925/SteveScriggins/ok well you can just stop right there
3926/SteveScriggins/you know the only reason anyone in town remembers you

3941/SteveScriggins/you're just more in love with yourself.
3942/SteveScriggins/or you're stupider.

3966/Sadie/what?
3967/Mae/I just realized that like...
3968/Mae/I did something helpful.
3969/Mae/Like I came up with a plan and did something good.
3970/Saleem/Is that strange?
3971/Mae/I feel like I just stumble into things all the time
3972/Mae/introducing you two is like...
3973/Mae/I *MEANT* to help out two strangers. And I did.
3974/Mae/And now you’re gonna play together
3975/Mae/and fall in love...
3976/Sadie/What? No.
3977/Saleem/I’m in a long term monogamous relationship.
3978/Sadie/I am not in the market.
3979/Sadie/And my son takes up most of my attention.
3980/Mae/Oh.
3981/Mae/Did I make it weird?
3982/Saleem/You made it weird.
3983/Sadie/Very weird.
3984/Mae/dammit
3985/Mae/Um. Hello.
3986/Sadie/Hello.

3996/Sadie/this is the only stage in town.
3997/Not Stated/are you on stage a lot?
3998/Sadie/nope. not for a long, long time at least
3999/Not Stated/that's not true!
4000/Mae/we just did a play at the hardware store!
4001/Mae/we used the counter as a stage!
4002/Sadie/ok, this is the only stage in town
4003/Sadie/that's only a stage.
4004/Mae/looks like no one's played here in a long time
4005/Sadie/yeah, been a few decades.
4006/Mae/are you gonna like
4007/Mae/put on something here?
4008/Sadie/oh, i don't think anyone's gonna be putting anything on here
4009/Sadie/at least not anytime soon.
4010/Sadie/no electricity, probably structurally unsound.
4011/Sadie/infested with rats and pigeons.
4012/Mae/other than the electricity that's like most of the town.
4013/Sadie/ha ha ha
4014/Sadie/that it is. that it is.
4015/Mae/Hi again.
4016/Sadie/It’s you, kid.

4018/Sadie/I’m 38. You’re a kid.
4019/Mae/Ok.
4020/Mae/How'd you find this place?
4021/Sadie/I mean I knew this was up here since I was a kid
4022/Sadie/but only got up the nerve to break in recently
4023/Mae/why is that?
4024/Sadie/not getting any younger
4025/Sadie/and this place could fall in any day
4026/Sadie/you get to a point in life
4027/Sadie/where the number of first-evers gets lower
4028/Sadie/and the number of never-agains gets higher
4029/Sadie/i dunno
4030/Mae/i know what you mean
4031/Sadie/no you don't.
4032/Mae/do you have a job or something?
4033/Sadie/i did.

4064/Sadie/huh. ok.
4065/Sadie/Well, if you see him again, tell him to stop by.
4066/Sadie/unless he’s a creep or something
4067/Mae/he doesn’t seem like a creep.
4068/Sadie/well, I got mace.
4069/Mae/I just met this guy over by the church steps
4070/Mae/he was also hanging by himself
4071/Mae/and playing music.

4078/Sadie/Do you know anything about this guy?
4079/Mae/He's not a murderer.
4080/Mae/I don't think he's a murderer.
4081/Sadie/Ok well... thanks?
4082/Mae/This wasn’t here before.
4083/Sadie/Yeah! Found them backstage.
4084/Saleem/Can’t believe they’re still intact.

4104/Saleem/The Deep Hollor Horrelors - goddammit
4105/Mae/HA HA.
4106/Saleem/The D.H.H. were *THE* premier dance band in Deep Hollow County
4107/Sadie/This was their club.
4108/Sadie/Four of ‘em. Violin, sax, tuba, accordion.
4109/Saleem/Polkas, Waltzes, old tunes from the hills.
4110/Saleem/20’s through the 40’s.
4111/Saleem/Took this town through some hard times.
4112/Saleem/They were on that famous anthology of appalachian music from the 60s.
4113/Sadie/Yeah. Big piece of local history.
4114/Not Stated/What happened to them?
4115/Sadie/oh yeah
4116/Sadie/weird story there
4117/Not Stated/What happened to this place?
4118/Sadie/After they were found out in the woods
4119/Sadie/it passed from owner to owner for a long time
4120/Mae/“Found”? “Out in the woods?”
4121/Sadie/oh yeah. Uh.
4122/Sadie/Weird story there.
4123/Saleem/They got spooky.
4124/Sadie/or kinda religious?
4125/Not Stated/spooky?
4126/Saleem/yeah they talked about taking trips out of their bodies
4127/Saleem/and were playing for the ghosts that have been through here.
4128/Mae/huh.
4129/Saleem/folks thought they were just being weird and poetic but
4130/Not Stated/religious?
4131/Sadie/yeah they started talking about how
4132/Sadie/they were playing for gods?
4133/Sadie/but like gods nobody knew about?
4134/Sadie/and they were taking trips out of their bodies?
4135/Saleem/who knows. They were also getting kind of old.
4136/Mae/that's weird.
4137/Sadie/In the end they stopped coming here
4138/Sadie/and started playing out in the woods
4139/Sadie/on these little… band box thingies they built
4140/Saleem/Or at least that’s what people figured
4141/Saleem/In November of ‘49 they found them dead way out there
4142/Saleem/Died of exposure!
4143/Saleem/Frost froze ‘em to their instruments!
4144/Sadie/Had to peel ‘em off the ground.
4145/Saleem/One of the great wtf moments in Possum Springs history.
4146/Mae/Holy crap.
4147/Sadie/How have you not heard this story?
4148/Mae/No it’s just...
4149/Mae/I...
4150/Mae/nothing. The world is big and weird.
4151/Saleem/After they were gone this place’s days were numbered.
4152/Saleem/And now! for the first time in god knows how long!
4153/Saleem/The Husker Bee Ballroom shall hear music again!
4154/Sadie/Ha ha ha.
4155/Saleem/And it’s a full house! Pigeons appreciate quality!
4156/Mae/This makes me happy.
4157/Sadie/Save the happiness for when we’re good.
4158/Saleem/Yeah. Let’s get good.
4159/Sadie/This place could use some good.
4160/Saleem/Well, that's one thing about music-
4161/Saleem/it fills empty space!
4162/Mae/holy shit. That’s a lot of birds.
4163/Mae/wow.

4201/Mae/Like, if you could be anywhere in… uh… 15 years, where would you be?
4202/Mae/and it was an easy assignment

4211/Mae/and we’re married, or no… like, whatever they do in Idaho
4212/Mae/my teacher wrote "i think they just get married"
4213/Mae/but no like i mean out on the frontier
4214/Mae/you just stay with someone long enough that it’s a thing.
4215/Mae/whatever. I can call it what i want.
4216/Mae/anyway, we go out and wander around and do work together
4217/Mae/and we come home and we’re all gross
4218/Mae/and your face feels like it does when it’s been windy all day
4219/Mae/it’s cold out
4220/Mae/and we order pizza
4221/Mae/my teacher was like "on a farm? in idaho?"
4222/Mae/yeah there’s a town nearby in this drawing
4223/Mae/it was a big drawing.
4224/Mae/and we eat pizza and I’m playing a video game
4225/Mae/and she’s making something
4226/Mae/like she does woodworking or she’s a blacksmith or something
4227/Mae/so she has really rough hands
4228/Mae/Teacher was like "She’s doing woodworking and-or blacksmithing in the living room?"
4229/Mae/and she has boots but like
4230/Mae/mine are muddy
4231/Mae/but hers are all scuffed up from work
4232/Mae/from the wood. Or the fire. Or something.
4233/Mae/and we have 2 big burly cats from a barn
4234/Mae/and a dog
4235/Mae/and we all howl at the moon together

4249/Mae/Farming.
4250/Mae/I could farm.
4251/Mae/If I stay in town long enough
4252/Mae/I could see getting into the farm life.
4253/Mae/the problem with farms
4254/Mae/is the amount of poop.
4255/Mae/like even if you don't have animals.
4256/Mae/you actually buy poop or something
4257/Mae/and shovel it all over the place.
4258/Mae/it's madness.
4259/Mae/it's poop madness.
4260/Mae/After this, a few miles and you go under the highway
4261/Mae/and it's just rolling fields and farms.
4262/Mae/I missed the corn mazes this fall.
4263/Mae/And the haunted barn in Briddle.
4264/Mae/always next year.
4265/Mae/for campfires and corndogs.
4266/Mae/weird that town ends like
4267/Mae/*BAM!*
4268/Mae/right here.
4269/Mae/there's like a line
4270/Mae/somewhere
4271/Mae/that no one can see.
4272/Mae/but you can put it on a map.
4273/Mae/wonder if we'll ever be a big booming town again.
4274/Mae/those guys last night were like
4275/Mae/deluded.
4276/Mae/but it'd be really nice.
4277/Mae/if there was a god
4278/Mae/i might ask.
4279/Mae/but i think they'd have to fight the other gods
4280/Mae/that bled this place nearly to death.
4281/Mae/i'm like
4282/Mae/proud of us all
4283/Mae/for having good-ass lives
4284/Mae/in a shitty, stupid, good-ass town.
4285/Mae/here's to you, Possum Springs.
4286/Mae/here's to survival.
4287/Mae/Hey look, some brochures!
4288/Mae/Excuse me, but where is everybody?
4289/Janitor/It's 10:45. It's closed.
4290/Janitor/Not a lot of folks getting off the last bus to Possum Springs these days.
4291/Janitor/Just you.
4292/Not Stated/Isn't there supposed to be someone at the desk?
4293/Not Stated/So are you the Janitor or something?
4294/Mae/How's that door coming? e_krinĝa
4295/Janitor/How's that soda coming?
4296/Mae/One Freeasscola.

4301/Janitor/Huh. Strange.
4302/Mae/When do you think that door's gonna be finished?
4303/Janitor/Now.
4304/Janitor/Goodbye.
4305/Mae/uh. bye.
4306/Janitor/Closed.
4307/Mae/Why are the lights on? Why is the TV on?
4308/Janitor/I get spooked when I'm here by my lonesome.
4309/Mae/Oh.
4310/Janitor/Looks that way.
4311/Mae/What do you do?
4312/Janitor/I fix this door.
4313/Mae/That's it?
4314/Janitor/Nope.
4315/Mae/Can I squeeze past you?
4316/Janitor/Nope. Just broke the damn thing.
4317/Mae/When do you think it might be done?
4318/Janitor/Right after you go grab me a Fiascola from the machine.
4319/Mae/...
4320/Mae/Am I paying for this?
4321/Janitor/I always rig it when I'm here after hours.
4322/Mae/Nice. Free as in free? e_ĝoja
4323/Janitor/Free as in no one's here to say otherwise.
4324/Mae/It's the ticket stand.
4325/TV/Welcome back to Garbo And Malloy!
4326/TV/What's in the news today, Malloy?
4327/TV/Markets were up today!
4328/TV/Waaaaaay up!
4329/TV/I'm looking at a chart and it's pretty impressive!
4330/TV/The economy added 15,000 jobs
4331/TV/mostly in the chart sector
4332/TV/which is notoriously recession proof!
4333/TV/My my, Garbo, we got a little political there!
4334/TV/Gotta get political every now and then.
4335/TV/I went on one of those internet dates last week.
4336/TV/Oh?
4337/TV/Yeah the internet is a truly giving lover.
4338/TV/Hey, any lovely ladies out there looking for an eligible bachelor?
4339/TV/Get in touch!
4340/TV/And I'll let you know if I find one!
4341/Mae/What the?
4342/Mae/They have Lime Fiasco and he wants a Fiascola?
4343/Mae/That's just a waste.
4344/Mae/Okay, just gotta grab it.
4345/Mae/e_ĝoja e_krinĝa Fiasco Fox you are too dreamy.
4346/Mae/Wow. When did they put this up?
4347/Mae/Possum Springs has never looked more...
4348/Mae/...falsely advertised. e_malĝojeta
4349/Mae/Visitors are going to be so let down when they see the actual town.
4350/Mae/Prepare to be disappointed, ye who enter here!
4351/Mae/Our Town Motto.
4352/Mae/State forest up top,
4353/Mae/Regular forest everywhere else.
4354/Mae/Woods, woods, woods.
4355/Mae/Look at that minecart.
4356/Mae/That's all long gone.
4357/Mae/Was this made by a time traveler?
4358/Mae/It must be such a relief to payphone companies that Possum Springs gets zero cell reception.
4359/Mae/It'd be cool to call my parents
4360/Mae/but some jerkhole took the time to actually rip it off.
4361/Mae/Who steals a phone?
4362/Mae/I wonder what they're doing with that phone.
4363/Mae/Sleeping with it at night.
4364/Mae/Taking it for walks.
4365/Mae/Holding it tight.
4366/Mae/Talking into it
4367/Mae/to nobody.
4368/Mae/Smooching it so right.
4369/Mae/Well, this is great.
4370/Mae/I mean I didn't expect a party or anything
4371/Mae/but I figured *someone* would be here.
4372/Mae/...
4373/Mae/Welcome home, Mae.
4374/Mae/Well I'm right outside town.
4375/Mae/Mom and dad nowhere to be found.
4376/Mae/Dark and cold.
4377/Mae/Guess I'm walking.
4378/Mae/Alone.
4379/Mae/Wow.
4380/Mae/I didn't realize how much I missed the sound of that train.
4381/Mae/I used to hear it in my bed at night
4382/Mae/during the winter when the leaves were down.
4383/Mae/This bus station is maybe the newest thing in Possum Springs.
4384/Mae/Guess they got state funding or something.
4385/Mae/It makes a good first or last impression I suppose
4386/Mae/if not for the abandoned glass factory back there.
4387/Mae/Not getting rid of that anytime soon.
4388/Mae/Well, I guess I'm gonna hike through the woods.
4389/Mae/Through the woods is home,

4485/Mae/ha ha. yeah.
4486/Mae/Liked the constellations. Hated school.
4487/Chazokov/Hey, don’t knock school. School is vital for your future!
4488/Chazokov/What are you doing back in Possum Springs?
4489/Mae/I dropped out of school.
4490/Chazokov/Oh.
4491/Chazokov/Well, if you’re still interested in constellations
4492/Chazokov/come by my roof down the hill later this week.
4493/Chazokov/Should have my new telescope set up by then.
4494/Mae/Sure thing!
4495/Chazokov/
4496/Mae/e_preta
4497/Mae/Hey Mr. Chazokov
4498/Chazokov/Did you jump down from the next door roof?
4499/Varney/I'm going to call the cops next time, Mae!
4500/Mae/Whatevs.
4501/Varney/What?
4502/Chazokov/I am like you, Mae. I am up here where a bear does not belong.
4503/Mae/Are you using a telescope to... uh...
4504/Mae/stare at the sun?
4505/Chazokov/No no no!
4506/Chazokov/I am calibrating for tonight, for something [color=dddddd][wave]amazing[/all]!
4507/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
4508/Mae/e_preta
4509/Mae/So what is this amazing thing?
4510/Chazokov/Castys will appear in the western sky!
4511/Mae/Who's Castys?
4512/Mae/What's Castys?
4513/Chazokov/Castys is a dusk star- a faint and wandering celestial object.
4514/Chazokov/The star tells the story of woman who built a tower to heaven
4515/Chazokov/And for this the gods sunk her deep into the sea.
4516/Mae/Wow. Jerks.
4517/Chazokov/But even in the depths, she refused to die.
4518/Mae/e_ĝoja
4519/Mae/DAMN STRAIGHT.
4520/Mae/e_neûtrala_1 e_neûtrala_2
4521/Chazokov/What do you think the story means?
4522/Not Stated/It means do awesome stuff and never die.
4523/Not Stated/It means screw the gods, they are total jerks.
4524/Chazokov/The gods are only stand-ins for things we cannot easily control.
4525/Chazokov/We might just say floods, or cancer, or what have you.
4526/Mae/Well, all of those things are jerks too. e_krinĝega
4527/Chazokov/You'll have no argument from me.
4528/Chazokov/But we can't control the stars either
4529/Chazokov/and they are bigger and brighter than we are.
4530/Mae/I might come back and check out your telescope sometime. e_mira
4531/Chazokov/My roof is your roof!
4532/Chazokov/Ho ho ho!
4533/Chazokov/If only it were that easy.
4534/Chazokov/Think of Mr. Applebaum.
4535/Mae/The statue guy?
4536/Chazokov/His statue stands, but he and his mine are gone.
4537/Mae/Well, I'm going to live forever. e_ĝoja
4538/Chazokov/I know you will, Mae.
4539/Mae/I'm an effing Dracula. e_brakoj_supren_gaje
4540/Chazokov/Oh no!
4541/Mae/e_neûtrala_1 e_neûtrala_2
4542/Mae/e_preta
4543/Mae/Are you an astrologer or something?
4544/Chazokov/The word is [wave]astronomer[/wave], and I am but an amateur.
4545/Mae/You know a lot for someone who isn't paid to know about it.
4546/Chazokov/That is one of the saddest sentences I've ever heard.
4547/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
4548/Mae/Sorry?
4549/Chazokov/Come back some evening, we'll cram some stars into that head of yours.
4550/Mae/e_ĝoja
4551/Mae/Will do!
4552/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
4553/Chazokov/My roof is your roof!
4554/Mae/That was pretty great.
4555/Chazokov/We can look again in two days time.
4556/Chazokov/Will you be back?
4557/Not Stated/Yeah if I remember!
4558/Not Stated/Probably not.
4559/Chazokov/Oh, you will be.
4560/Chazokov/No one can resist the stars forever.
4561/Mae/That’s spooky, Mr. Chazokov.
4562/Chazokov/Beh heh heh hehe.
4563/Chazokov/Mae Borowski! You could have knocked on the door down there.
4564/Chazokov/Impolite to be on other people’s roofs!
4565/Varney/Next time I’m gonna call the cops!
4566/Mae/Whatever.
4567/Chazokov/Beh heh heh heh!
4568/Chazokov/At any rate, I am glad you have accepted my invitation!
4569/Mae/What are you doing anyway?
4570/Chazokov/Hunting dusk stars!
4571/Not Stated/What’s dusk stars?
4572/Chazokov/Wandering stars the light of which does not come through at night.
4573/Mae/How does that work?
4574/Chazokov/It is a trick of the atmosphere and setting sunlight.
4575/Chazokov/Only visible for few weeks every year in the spring and fall, so lovely.
4576/Mae/Neato.
4577/Not Stated/Dusk Stars is the name of my shoegaze band.
4578/Chazokov/Really?
4579/Mae/No.
4580/Chazokov/It is music of looking at shoes?
4581/Mae/With a lot of reverb.
4582/Chazokov/Why are we talking about shoes?
4583/Mae/I forget.
4584/Chazokov/Want to have a look?
4585/Not Stated/Yeah!
4586/Chazokov/Excellent!!!
4587/Not Stated/Maybe later.
4588/Chazokov/Suit yourself. I’ll be up here all afternoon.

4627/Not Stated/No thanks
4628/Chazokov/Suit yourself!
4629/Mae/Pretty sweet. The stars, I mean.
4630/Chazokov/I am in agreement
4631/Mae/So uh
4632/Mae/are those star stories supposed to have morals or something?
4633/Chazokov/I think you have to figure that out for yourself, Mae.
4634/Mae/If it only means something because I want it to
4635/Mae/then it doesn’t really mean anything, right?
4636/Chazokov/...
4637/Mae/What?
4638/Chazokov/I have to think about that one for a bit.
4639/Chazokov/Change your mind?
4640/Not Stated/Yeah... I mean... stars are cool.
4641/Chazokov/That thought has been the basis of my entire career.
4642/Chazokov/Have a look!
4643/Not Stated/No, just looking at your telescope.
4644/Chazokov/She’s a beauty!
4645/Chazokov/Hey Mae.

4652/Chazokov/and yet
4653/Chazokov/this is the first we've spoken since you've been home.
4654/Mae/That's odd.
4655/Mae/are you up here all the time?
4656/Chazokov/rather often. It's a great vantage point!
4657/Chazokov/you should stop by sometime! see the universe!
4658/Mae/sounds like a plan, Mr. Chazokov.
4659/Chazokov/you take care, mae!
4660/Mae/Got any more dusk stars we can look at?

4676/Chazokov/See you soon, stargazer.
4677/Mae/e_preta
4678/Mae/Are you an astrologer or something?
4679/Chazokov/The word is [wave]astronomer[/wave], and I am but an amateur.
4680/Mae/You know a lot for someone who isn't paid to know about it.
4681/Chazokov/That is one of the saddest sentences I've ever heard.
4682/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
4683/Mae/Sorry?
4684/Chazokov/Come back in a couple days, we'll cram some stars into that head of yours.
4685/Mae/e_ĝoja
4686/Mae/Will do!
4687/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
4688/Mae/so how many stars are there?
4689/Chazokov/...
4690/Mae/what?
4691/Mae/i mean the ones we're looking for!

5127/Dan/In fact, it’s often laying off guys named Dan.
5128/Mae/What are you going to do?
5129/Dan/I’m open to suggestions.
5130/Not Stated/Don’t give up!

5135/Mae/Good. Just dropped out of college and I’m living with my parents.
5136/Dan/Oh.
5137/Dan/So you’re basically a teenager again.
5138/Mae/NO.
5139/Mae/I’m just an adult living with her parents.
5140/Dan/Oh ok so it’s not like you’re unemployed
5141/Dan/it’s like you’re lacking a daytime hobby
5142/Dan/that pays money you don’t need for rent.
5143/Mae/Alright, I’m gonna get going.
5144/Dan/Yeah.
5145/Dan/Construction's always hiring, Rob!
5146/Dan/Well, at least the coffee shop is still open.
5147/Dan/Even if it's not hiring.
5148/Dan/Well there’s always a chance someone will die
5149/Dan/And I can have their job.
5150/Mae/Dan, you’re not gonna like
5151/Mae/kill anyone, are you?
5152/Dan/Does it pay?
5153/Dan/I’ve been out of work for a year before.
5154/Dan/And this time I only lasted 6 months before being laid off.
5155/Dan/Do you know what that does to a resume?
5156/Mae/Not really.
5157/Dan/I have a zombie resume.
5158/Dan/It’s dead but somehow it’s still going all over the place.

5401/Mae/He's a vampire and a scientist.
5402/Mae/He invented a blood rocket.
5403/Gregg/Wow, you gave him a backstory too.
5404/Mae/Don't talk about the professor like he isn't here.
5405/Gregg/...
5406/Gregg/...I miss Mr. Gnome.

5408/Mae/I even gave him a name.
5409/Mae/Professor Lucius Von Gnomeo. e_ĝoja
5410/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
5411/Gregg/Lucky for short.
5412/Not Stated/Do you remember that one Witchdagger song about the well?
5413/Not Stated/So you and Angus are really leaving?
5414/Gregg/e_kria
5415/Gregg/Yeah, the [shake=.1]DAH-DAH-DUUUUURGA[/shake] song?
5416/Gregg/e_neûtrala_1
5417/Gregg/That song totally slays.
5418/Mae/You know how the one verse is like
5419/Mae/"[wave]Deep cold
5420/Mae/darkest hole
5421/Mae/in the center of everything[/wave]"?
5422/Gregg/e_kria
5423/Gregg/DAH-DAH-DUUUUURGA!!!
5424/Gregg/e_neûtrala_1
5425/Mae/I used to think that song was just badass witch stuff.
5426/Not Stated/But the other night I had a dream about it.
5427/Not Stated/But now it just makes me sad.
5428/Gregg/Mae, we gotta.
5429/Gregg/I'm too much for this town to handle
5430/Gregg/and Angus needs to be out of the sun as much as possible.
5431/Mae/You know they have the sun in Bright Harbor, right?
5432/Gregg/Mae, Bright Harbor has SO MANY Donut Wolfs.
5433/Gregg/And punk shows.
5434/Gregg/And people who aren't all straight gun nuts.
5435/Not Stated/I think they have guns in Bright Harbor too.
5436/Not Stated/You *HAVE* a gun! We shot your old tv with it!
5437/Gregg/What kind of dream?
5438/Mae/I was standing beside this well in the middle of some field.
5439/Mae/And it was all rainy and foggy.
5440/Gregg/Mmhmm?
5441/Mae/And I kept trying to back away from it
5442/Mae/but every time I moved I slipped in the mud and ended up closer to the well.
5443/Gregg/Crap.
5444/Mae/So I just had to stand still.
5445/Mae/Not move at all.
5446/Gregg/That sounds freaky, dude.
5447/Mae/And the worst thing was
5448/Mae/There was something deep down in the well.
5449/Mae/Looking up at me.
5450/Gregg/Thanks a lot dude, I'm totally gonna have nightmares now.
5451/Gregg/That was a hunting rifle my dad gave me.
5452/Gregg/That doesn't count.
5453/Mae/What does your dad think about you leaving?
5454/Gregg/I dunno.
5455/Gregg/He's always too nice for me to know what he actually thinks.
5456/Mae/Hey Gregg?
5457/Gregg/Yeah?
5458/Mae/I'm going to be really sad when you go, asshole.
5459/Gregg/I know.
5460/Gregg/Why?
5461/Mae/I think about, like, a really deep hole e_malĝojeta
5462/Mae/and not being able to get out.
5463/Gregg/Are you afraid someone is going to throw you down a well?
5464/Mae/No. e_neûtrala_1
5465/Gregg/Because I am totally gonna chuck your ass down a well.
5466/Gregg/e_kria
5467/Gregg/DAH-DAH-DUUUUURGA!!!
5468/Gregg/e_neûtrala_1
5469/Gregg/Mae, in my uncle's living room there are 8 different guns within reach of the couch.
5470/Mae/Wow, really?
5471/Gregg/Yeah I think he's waiting for the FBI to come over the hill.
5472/Mae/Coming for his 8 guns?
5473/Gregg/He's our last line of defense.
5474/Gregg/Hey remember that time in 9th grade when we made that bomb from off the internet?
5475/Mae/The megaboom! You lost your eyebrows!
5476/Gregg/A little more gasoline and I'd be wearing cool shades right now
5477/Gregg/to cover the horrifying ruin of my charred, empty eye sockets.
5478/Mae/Hey Gregg?
5479/Gregg/Yeah?
5480/Mae/I'm going to be really sad when you go, asshole.
5481/Gregg/I know.
5482/Mae/e_malĝoja
5483/Mae/I'm just... sad. And angry.
5484/Gregg/Yeah for real, dude.
5485/Mae/I come back home and everyone's already made other plans.
5486/Mae/I just want to hold on to something
5487/Mae/and like...
5488/Mae/Everything is ending, but I want more.
5489/Gregg/Mae, we can't stay here forever.
5490/Mae/... e_neûtrala_1
5491/Mae/I know.
5492/Gregg/How 'bout you, me and...
5493/Mae/Professor Lucius Von Gnomeo.
5494/Gregg/How 'bout you, me and the professor go break some lightbulbs behind the Snack Falcon?
5495/Mae/Yes? Obviously?
5496/Gregg/And Christine gave me a key for when I open,
5497/Gregg/Which means all you can slurp slushies, on me!
5498/Mae/These are the nights I'll remember when I'm 60.
5499/Gregg/Also I stole a bunch of lighter fluid so we can set something pretty big on fire!
5500/Mae/AWWOOOOOOOOOOOO!
5501/Gregg/You know, Christine gave me a key for when I open.
5502/Gregg/Which means free post-donut slushies!
5503/Mae/I wish that gnome was still with us.
5504/Gregg/Mae, some things you just have to let go.
5505/Mae/...
5506/Mae/Yeah.
5507/Gregg/Come on, let's go steal from my boss, who trusted me.
5508/Mae/These are the nights I'll remember when I'm 60.
5509/Gregg/Also I stole a bunch of lighter fluid so we can set something pretty big on fire!

5530/Mae/i hate awkward silences. e_mira
5531/Mae/am i like ruining your lives or something?

5536/Mae/why are you being weird, then?
5537/Not Stated/am i like making things weird, Gregg?

5546/Mae/yeah. kinda. e_neûtrala_1
5547/Gregg/when i was like 8 my parents got sick of me
5548/Gregg/and made me spend like a month there in the summer.
5549/Gregg/and i spent the whole time following him around.
5550/Not Stated/sheep are cool.
5551/Mae/i had a stuffed sheep named Gordon.
5552/Not Stated/sheep are nice.
5553/Mae/i got to pet one once.
5554/Gregg/sheep are real dumb is what they are.
5555/Gregg/one afternoon before dinner my uncle left me by the pen
5556/Gregg/and for some reason, i opened the gate.
5557/Not Stated/why?
5558/Gregg/i have no idea.
5559/Gregg/kids are like sheep.
5560/Gregg/real dumb.
5561/Mae/they so are.
5562/Not Stated/what did they do?
5563/Gregg/so a bunch of the sheep basically immediately bolted
5564/Gregg/and i chased after, being all
5565/Gregg/YOU DUMBASS SHEEP!
5566/Angus/you tried, bug.
5567/Gregg/they ran across the field
5568/Gregg/and into the woods
5569/Gregg/and there was this really steep hill
5570/Gregg/that went down to the interstate.
5571/Mae/oh... oh no...
5572/Mae/what happened?
5573/Gregg/4 got splattered by a semi truck
5574/Gregg/some ran back up the hill
5575/Gregg/but three made it over the median
5576/Gregg/and across to the other side.
5577/Gregg/and they just... stopped.
5578/Gregg/and i got to the bottom of the hill, by the road
5579/Gregg/which was like covered in sheep guts and parts
5580/Mae/*urp*
5581/Gregg/and we just looked at each other across the interstate.
5582/Gregg/me waving my hands
5583/Gregg/two ran back, got hit by *another* truck
5584/Not Stated/god.
5585/Not Stated/did the trucks stop?
5586/Gregg/THEY TOTALLY DIDN'T!
5587/Mae/that's probably illegal.
5588/Gregg/but the other one
5589/Gregg/he ran down the hill on the other side
5590/Gregg/into the woods.
5591/Gregg/and no one ever saw him again.
5592/Mae/geez, dude.
5593/Not Stated/hey- your tattoo!
5594/Gregg/yeah.
5595/Mae/ha ha. I sleuthed the meaning.
5596/Not Stated/what happened after that?
5597/Gregg/i mean i ran back to the farm, crying.
5598/Gregg/my uncle hit me a bunch.
5599/Mae/no.
5600/Gregg/yeah.
5601/Gregg/there was some legal stuff
5602/Gregg/and they moved away not long after.
5603/Mae/that's awful for you.
5604/Mae/poor sheep.
5605/Gregg/but if i was in their position, i'd have run too
5606/Gregg/and i want to be the one that got away.
5607/Gregg/and i want angus to come with me.
5608/Gregg/I like, failed those sheep.
5609/Gregg/just like, you know... everything... has failed us.
5610/Mae/that's a bit-
5611/Gregg/no one even denies it.
5612/Gregg/no one tries to talk you out of leaving here.
5613/Gregg/and yeah, being the only queer people in town sucks.
5614/Mae/i'm here!
5615/Gregg/you already left once!
5616/Mae/but i'm...

5620/Gregg/and I love Angus.
5621/Angus/I love both of you.
5622/Angus/obviously in different ways.
5623/Mae/thanks for clarifying.
5624/Gregg/we have a plan and we're working our asses off to make it happen.
5625/Angus/two guys, full time, minimum wage.
5626/Gregg/i have to grow up a bit.
5627/Gregg/i *did* grow up a bit.
5628/Gregg/Mae. You have to let me change.
5629/Angus/sorry i was rude earlier.

5737/Mae/yep.
5738/Mae/that's pretty new.
5739/Mae/hey angus, how'd you get bea's car for tonight?
5740/Angus/she was going to go to a party out of town
5741/Angus/but i guess she lost her nerve.

5744/Mae/this is something!
5745/Angus/let's just eat.
5746/Gregg/yes please let's eat.
5747/Mae/woohoo! e_ĝoja
5748/Mae/So... got a gnome, a fishing pole, a badminton racket, and a fan.
5749/Mae/Got two wheels and a... turny thing... with no wheel.
5750/Mae/Probably just need to turn the turny thing...
5751/Not Stated/...to open up the heat pipes.
5752/Mae/Clanky’s probably got loads of heat but it can’t get out.
5753/Not Stated/...to turn up the fire.
5754/Mae/Clanky’s probably got a tiny fire going and could use some help.
5755/Mae/We’ve all been there! Poor Clanky.
5756/Mae/to get Clanky all hot and bothered.
5757/Mae/We will teach Clanky to love.
5758/Mae/I bet I could... hm...
5759/Not Stated/I think Gnomey could bite onto the turny thing where the wheel was.
5760/Not Stated/Could use racket as a handle.
5761/Mae/Ok yeah. That’s the stuff.
5762/Mae/Probably could like... pull him?
5763/Not Stated/But we’re not always going to be here to pull him...
5764/Not Stated/I think one good hard pull should be enough.
5765/Mae/Yeah that would work.
5766/Not Stated/Although we’re not always going to be here to pull it...
5767/Not Stated/One good hard pull should do it.
5768/Mae/The fan could stay on, and then if this breaks you only have to replace the fan...
5769/Mae/It should be good for the environment too. That’s important.
5770/Mae/Like the turbines on the mountain by Fort Lucenne.
5771/Mae/God, I remember when everyone was so mad about that
5772/Mae/“It’s gonna ruin the view! It’s gonna kill birds!”
5773/Mae/You know what else is gonna ruin the view and birds?
5774/Mae/When a meteor hits the earth because it gets too hot.
5775/Mae/That’s what happened to the dinosaurs.
5776/Mae/ok where was I?
5777/Not Stated/Dinosaurs were effing rad.
5778/Not Stated/Making a basement turbine out of a badminton racket.
5779/Mae/ok, focus. work this out Mae Borowski.
5780/Not Stated/I’m hungry.
5781/Not Stated/I wonder what it’s like to get stuck in a cave.
5782/Mae/The fan could stay on, and then if this breaks you only have to replace the fan...
5783/Mae/It should be good for the environment too. That’s important.
5784/Mae/Like the turbines on the mountain by Fort Lucenne.
5785/Mae/God, I remember when everyone was so mad about that
5786/Mae/“It’s gonna ruin the view! It’s gonna kill birds!”
5787/Mae/You know what else is gonna ruin the view and birds?
5788/Mae/When a meteor hits the earth because it gets too hot.
5789/Mae/That’s what happened to the dinosaurs.
5790/Mae/ok where was I?
5791/Not Stated/Dinosaurs were effing rad.
5792/Not Stated/Making a basement turbine out of a garden gnome.
5793/Mae/They had dinosaurs in the ocean too!
5794/Mae/I’m glad I wasn’t a fish back then.
5795/Mae/Did they have fish? Were they like dinosaur fish?
5796/Not Stated/No. Fish are fish, Mae. Get a grip.
5797/Not Stated/I mean they’d have to be dinosaur fish, right?
5798/Mae/Ok so... hm...
5799/Mae/How much space do we have down here?
5800/Not Stated/Looks like not much.
5801/Not Stated/We got plenty of room.
5802/Mae/So there isn’t a lot of wind down here, but like
5803/Mae/Could put the fan on Gnomey’s butt
5804/Mae/And that would make it spin...
5805/Mae/Racket for the other fin part.
5806/Mae/Tie it all together with the fishing line and WOW
5807/Mae/I should, like, start a company
5808/Mae/SUSTAINABLE GARBAGE TURBINE!!!
5809/Bea/Ok done!
5810/Mae/What?!
5811/Mae/Right.
5812/Mae/They had dinosaurs in the ocean too!
5813/Mae/I’m glad I wasn’t a fish back then.
5814/Mae/Did they have fish? Were they like dinosaur fish?
5815/Not Stated/No. Fish are fish, Mae. Get a grip.
5816/Not Stated/I mean they’d have to be dinosaur fish, right?
5817/Mae/So there isn’t a lot of wind down here, but like
5818/Mae/ok we stick Gnomey in the ground
5819/Mae/sorry Gnomey
5820/Mae/put the fan on top of his flat table-butt
5821/Mae/I feel that pain, Gnomey. I have one too.
5822/Mae/And tie the racket on like this...
5823/Mae/Hey alright!
5824/Mae/I should, like, start a company
5825/Mae/SUSTAINABLE GARBAGE TURBINE!!!
5826/Bea/Ok done!
5827/Mae/What?!
5828/Mae/Could go for some of that Wolf.
5829/Mae/That D-D-Donut Wolf.
5830/Mae/There’s that video online of their slammercake machine
5831/Mae/watching it was how I fell asleep like half the nights at school.
5832/Mae/Big complicated machine making delicious cake-ums.
5833/Mae/I can’t imagine how anyone built something like that
5834/Mae/Everything works perfectly but it’s so weird looking
5835/Mae/Like someone was just making it up as they went along
5836/Mae/and somehow created perfection.
5837/Mae/I saw this thing on tv about people that scuba dive in caves.
5838/Mae/Which, for my money, is really stupid.
5839/Mae/Like in normal swimming you can drown
5840/Mae/but you’re not in a cave, with horses and stuff.
5841/Mae/"Horses?" I meant hoses.
5842/Mae/Why am I thinking of horses?
5843/Mae/OMG.
5844/Mae/CAVE HORSES.
5845/Mae/What if you were trapped by a cave horse?
5846/Mae/I wonder how they’d pull you out?
5847/Mae/Probably just have to wing it, make some big complicated thing
5848/Mae/I can’t imagine there’s a machine made just for pulling scuba divers away from cave horses...
5849/Mae/Although who knows what happens down there?
5850/Mae/Aaaagh! Focus, Mae!
5851/Mae/Maybe I should just wing this too? Just do it fast so I don’t overthink it?
5852/Mae/OK LET’S DO IT!
5853/Mae/ok tie the racket to the turny thing and then tie THAT to the fan but wait
5854/Mae/how am i going to keep the fan from rolling up like a big fan fish
5855/Mae/ok sorry gnomey i have to put you upside down like a vampire
5856/Mae/i think they used to bury vampires upside down so when they tried to dig out
5857/Mae/of their coffins they’d just dig down because ha ha ha ha stupid vampire
5858/Mae/now you’re in the center of the earth and you died.
5859/Mae/again.
5860/Mae/Hey this looks great!
5861/Mae/I’m like... an engineer!
5862/Mae/Or whoever makes machines!
5863/Mae/A machinegineer?
5864/Mae/Alright let’s give this baby a go-
5865/Bea/Ok done!
5866/Mae/What?!
5867/Mae/Right.
5868/Mae/Fish were probably like aw man what the HELL.
5869/Mae/“I can’t believe future fish don’t have to deal with this BS.”
5870/Mae/“Sharks? Heh. Get a load of Piranha Nessie with rabies over here.”
5871/Mae/Documentary guy is all like
5872/Mae/“Millions of years ago the seas were full of Piranha Rabies Nessies.”
5873/Mae/Ok FOCUS Mae.
5874/Mae/Making a turbine.
5875/Mae/Yeah, I mean back then they had dinosaur bugs, dinosaur trees, dinosaur poop.
5876/Mae/I’d like to see a dinosaur moose. I bet that would’ve been pretty great.
5877/Mae/Ok FOCUS Mae.
5878/Mae/Making a turbine.
5879/Mae/Fish were probably like aw man what the HELL.
5880/Mae/“I can’t believe future fish don’t have to deal with this BS.”
5881/Mae/“Sharks? Heh. Get a load of Piranha Nessie with rabies over here.”
5882/Mae/Documentary guy is all like
5883/Mae/“Millions of years ago the seas were full of Piranha Rabies Nessies.”
5884/Mae/Ok FOCUS Mae.
5885/Mae/Making a turbine.
5886/Mae/Yeah, I mean back then they had dinosaur bugs, dinosaur trees, dinosaur poop.
5887/Mae/I’d like to see a dinosaur moose. I bet that would’ve been pretty great.
5888/Mae/Ok FOCUS Mae.
5889/Mae/Making a turbine.
5890/Mae/Ok so something compact.
5891/Mae/Think Mae...
5892/Not Stated/I wonder what Gregg’s up to?
5893/Not Stated/What was the name of that one movie?
5894/Mae/hm... focus, Mae.
5895/Not Stated/I wonder if I’ll ever get that motorcycle.
5896/Not Stated/I wonder what happened to Casey’s boat?
5897/Mae/Oh wait, what’s gonna stop the fan from moving?
5898/Mae/RACKET!!!
5899/Mae/Alright well that looks perfect!
5900/Mae/Got Gnomey as the handle,
5901/Mae/the fan as the puller,
5902/Mae/the line connecting them,
5903/Mae/and the racket keeping the fan in place.
5904/Mae/This is amazing!
5905/Bea/Ok done!
5906/Mae/What?!
5907/Mae/Wonder if he figured out that thing...
5908/Mae/I remember when Casey had that job at the BurgBear out by Briddle.
5909/Mae/And he let us behind the counter to make whatever burgs we wanted
5910/Mae/but then Jeff the manager came in and we had to jump out the drivethrough window
5911/Mae/and Gregg’s leg got caught in some sort of cable
5912/Not Stated/and a car almost ran over him
5913/Not Stated/and he puked
5914/Mae/The one where the guy got tied to that machine by that other guy.
5915/Mae/And like totally got ripped in half?
5916/Mae/That was pretty cool even if it looked faaaake.
5917/Mae/I remember when he exploded there were like
5918/Mae/twice as many bones as there should have been.
5919/Not Stated/I wonder how that slipped past them?
5920/Not Stated/Alright FOCUS Mae.
5921/Mae/A cool bike that isn’t dumb and loud because that hurts my ears
5922/Mae/Drag-racin’.
5923/Mae/Can you drag race on bikes?
5924/Mae/Or is that like a car thing?
5925/Mae/That one old movie had the monster guy with the monster drag racer.
5926/Mae/And he had a cool helmet and cool boots and it was the coolest thing ever.
5927/Mae/Hm... could drag Gnomey...
5928/Mae/Use the fan as like a wheel?
5929/Mae/He had, like, a boat.
5930/Mae/I think it was his dad’s before he died.
5931/Mae/Lose a really shitty dad, get a boat!
5932/Mae/During that flood the year granddad died, he rode it through the neighborhood
5933/Mae/which was one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen.
5934/Mae/but he almost hit that swimming dog with the propeller
5935/Mae/life on the sea is dangerous
5936/Mae/...hm... could use the fan as like a propeller... wheel... thing...
5937/Mae/rev it up and let it yank Gnomey?
5938/Mae/Tie gnomey to the racket, tie the racket to the fan...
5939/Mae/Yeah Mae. That’s the stuff.
5940/Mae/This is genius. I am a genius.
5941/Mae/Alright let’s give this a shot-
5942/Bea/Ok done!
5943/Mae/What?!
5944/Mae/but Jeff never caught us!
5945/Mae/like, upside down
5946/Mae/and he like... puked up his nose?
5947/Mae/and then he puked again and it was like
5948/Mae/perpetual puke for a few seconds
5949/Mae/and I had to pull him out...
5950/Mae/and we couldn’t stop laughing...
5951/Mae/...could tie Gnomie to the to fan...
5952/Mae/In honor of Gregg.
5953/Mae/Maybe better movies have a bone supervisor
5954/Mae/So things like this don’t happen.
5955/Mae/Ok so let’s tie Gnomey to the fan...
5956/Mae/With the fishing line
5957/Mae/And THAT could pull him?
5958/Mae/But it won’t rip him in half.
5959/Mae/Gnomey don’t even got bones.
5960/Mae/CORPSEDRIVER!
5961/Mae/What’s what the movie was called.
5962/Mae/I shall call my machine Corpsedriver.
5963/Gregg/Aw yeah. Froggy robot.
5964/SteveScriggins/Finally. Goddamn.
5965/Mae/Oh shut up Steve.
5966/Gregg/Yeah! Robot piggy!
5967/SteveScriggins/Finally. Goddamn.

5971/Mae/Oh shut up Steve.
5972/Mae/Oh god. These guys.
5973/Mae/I was both terrified and super into these things
5974/Mae/when they'd put them out front.
5975/Mae/They moved!
5976/Gregg/They look so tiny when they're in pieces.
5977/Not Stated/I dunno man they're still pretty big.
5978/Mae/God, these things were actually gigantic when they had them out.
5979/Not Stated/We're smaller in pieces too.
5980/Gregg/Too real.
5981/Gregg/I hope you get chopped up by a chopper.
5982/Mae/I hope you get chopped up by a blunt chopper.
5983/SteveScriggins/You two are weird.
5984/Gregg/ok, we're stealing one of these
5985/Mae/is it even stealing?
5986/Gregg/it's better if we think of it as stealing.
5987/Mae/cool
5988/Gregg/aaaagh.
5989/Not Stated/aaagh?
5990/Not Stated/what?

6008/Mae/I don't care.
6009/Mae/He's scum and a criminal and anyway I think he's been bad news from the start.
6010/Gregg/Mm. Yes.
6011/Mae/What deal did you make with him?
6012/Gregg/He's allowed to shoplift whatever he wants from the Snack Falcon while I'm working.

6111/Not Stated/Pig Head
6112/Not Stated/Rabbit Head
6113/Gregg/Ugh... which one?
6114/Gregg/I'm bad at decisions that actually mean something.
6115/Mae/You picked out the tuxes we wore to junior prom.
6116/Gregg/Ok yeah... I'm pretty good at it.
6117/Mae/Remember how Tim Whitley rode that giant tractor into homecoming?
6118/Gregg/Totally.
6119/Gregg/So... did you pick?
6120/Not Stated/Dude gimme time.
6121/Gregg/Ugh fine.
6122/Mae/Dude, is this serious business?
6123/Gregg/This is serious business.
6124/Mae/Ok then let's treat it like serious business.
6125/Gregg/I'm hungry though.
6126/Mae/Uuuugh me too.
6127/Gregg/We should eat later.
6128/Mae/Yeah probably.
6129/SteveScriggins/I DO HAVE places to be, you know!
6130/Not Stated/I totally did.
6131/Gregg/Oh cool
6132/Gregg/Which one are we going with?
6133/Not Stated/YOU GIVE ME A SEC.
6134/Mae/e_brakoj_supren_gaje
6135/Gregg/DUDE. CHILL.
6136/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
6137/Not Stated/Um... ok. I think I got it.
6138/Gregg/Sweeeeet.

6140/Not Stated/Nope!
6141/Not Stated/Yep!
6142/Gregg/YAY!
6143/Gregg/
6144/SteveScriggins/
6145/Gregg/So this still works sometimes?
6146/SteveScriggins/Eh.
6147/SteveScriggins/You know Beth Holstead?
6148/Gregg/Yeah.
6149/SteveScriggins/She was in here like 6 months ago and she swears it talked.
6150/Gregg/Whoa.
6151/SteveScriggins/Didn't even have to push the button.
6152/SteveScriggins/But I dunno how much stake I’d put in it.
6153/SteveScriggins/You know Beth.
6154/Gregg/Kinda?
6155/SteveScriggins/There’s a lot of glue in here.
6156/Gregg/I guess.
6157/SteveScriggins/
6158/SteveScriggins/GODDAMMIT!!!
6159/Mae/What?
6160/SteveScriggins/Someone locked the effin’ door!
6161/SteveScriggins/Goddammit I bet it was Beth.
6162/SteveScriggins/Or Levy.
6163/SteveScriggins/Or the train trash.
6164/Gregg/So...
6165/SteveScriggins/AAAAAAAAAAAARGH
6166/SteveScriggins/They better not have stolen anything.
6167/Mae/...from the abandoned grocery store...
6168/Mae/...with the unlocked doors…
6169/Mae/What’s behind this door anyway?
6170/SteveScriggins/Could probably bust it open...
6171/Gregg/Or I could go get my lockpick stuff.
6172/Mae/I bet there’s like a key or something.
6173/SteveScriggins/Whatever.
6174/Mae/What are you doing?
6175/Gregg/Trying to find something to help bust down the door.
6176/Mae/Cool. I’m looking for a key because I’m smarter.
6177/Gregg/Uh huh. But I get to hit things.
6178/Mae/...
6179/Mae/crap.
6180/Gregg/How much glue did they need in here?
6181/Mae/Dude you gotta stick stuff to stuff to run a successful business.
6182/Gregg/Well, apparently not.
6183/Gregg/What are you doing?
6184/Mae/Gonna check that office up there.
6185/Gregg/Cool. Don’t like slice yourself to death on the glass.
6186/Mae/Dumb death.
6187/Gregg/Dumb death.
6188/Mae/Yo idiots stop kicking before you break your femurs or something.
6189/Gregg/I’m not an idiot.
6190/Mae/Yeah sorry hey idiot and Gregg stop kicking.
6191/Mae/I got keys.
6192/SteveScriggins/Where’d you get them?
6193/Mae/Office. Up there.
6194/SteveScriggins/No wonder this place went under.
6195/SteveScriggins/Leaving keys all over the place!
6196/Mae/That was exactly what I thought.
6197/Mae/I’m upset that we thought like the exact same words.
6198/SteveScriggins/I thought it better.
6199/Mae/
6200/Not Stated/Why are we doing crimes with this guy?
6201/Gregg/Robbers can’t be choosers.
6202/Mae/They really can.
6203/SteveScriggins/You know I can hear you, right?
6204/Not Stated/Ugh. Why did it have to be Steve?
6205/Gregg/He had an in.
6206/Mae/What in?
6207/SteveScriggins/I broke the front door.
6208/Mae/e_ĝoja e_brakoj_supren_gaje [wave]My babies!!!
6209/Mae/My little rat babies...
6210/Mae/Well, not so little anymore.
6211/Mae/You've made it! You've broken free!

6213/Mae/e_neûtrala_2 I'm just gonna enjoy this moment for a bit. e_mira
6214/Mae/Don't mind me...

6222/Gregg/AAAH MY FACE
6223/Mae/Out of pierogis!!!
6224/Gregg/Dang.
6225/Gregg/You know, a majority of those attempts hit me directly in the face.
6226/Mae/Sorry about that.
6227/Gregg/A majority of those made it into my mouth so I'm happy.
6228/Mae/Alright!
6229/Gregg/A lot of those ended up on the floor. I'm sad now.
6230/Mae/Aw, sorry Gregg.
6231/Mae/e_ĝoja e_mirega
6232/Mae/OH MY GOD.
6233/Mae/The UREV is still here!
6234/Bea/Ha ha yeah. This old thing.
6235/Mae/I can feel the edginess from here.
6236/Bea/Just looking in there makes me feel old.
6237/Mae/We are so gonna do this.
6238/Bea/There is no way I'm going in there.
6239/Mae/
6240/Mae/And yet Dollar Empire is still here?!
6241/Bea/I think this is one thing the internet can't compete with.
6242/Not Stated/I guess.
6243/Not Stated/I used to go in here when I was a kid
6244/Mae/You could get an eraser for a dollar, e_ĝoja
6245/Mae/a pencil for a dollar,
6246/Bea/that actually doesn't sound like a good deal
6247/Mae/Oh god you're right. e_malĝoja
6248/Bea/You up for eating?
6249/Not Stated/Let's check out the rest of the mall first.
6250/Not Stated/Yeah!
6251/Mae/Work up an appetite.
6252/Bea/I was kinda hungry when we got here...
6253/Mae/Let's eat! e_brakoj_supren_gaje
6254/Bea/Ok.
6255/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
6256/Mae/I expected more excitement.
6257/Bea/Mall food court dinner.
6258/Bea/Oh what a feeling.
6259/Mae/See? That wasn't hard.
6260/Bea/What did you get?
6261/Bea/You inhaled it before I got a look.
6262/Not Stated/Pizzataco from Go-fer
6263/Bea/Go-fer is some GOOD garbage food.
6264/Mae/Yeah I wish we'd get one in town.
6265/Bea/Oooh that would be bad for me.
6266/Mae/It'd be worth it.
6267/Not Stated/Pierogiburger from Smelterburger
6268/Bea/That's just a big pile of carbs and meat, huh?
6269/Mae/Isn't that what WE are?
6270/Bea/Bones too.
6271/Mae/I don't want bones in my burger.
6272/Bea/
6273/Mae/What?
6274/Bea/...
6275/Mae/Remember when Cathy Daminco pulled out Cindy Clark's nosering here?
6276/Bea/You know what that was about, right?
6277/Mae/Wasn't Cathy pregnant with... what was his name... football guy...
6278/Bea/Ron Boonstra. I didn't know you knew about that.
6279/Mae/Well I mean there was the first football game of our senior year
6280/Mae/and Ron ran up to the sideline and yelled at the stands
6281/Mae/"MY FIRST TOUCHDOWN'S FOR MY BEAUTIFUL FIRSTBORN AND HIS MOMMY, CATHY DAMINCO"
6282/Bea/That's... something.
6283/Mae/Cathy was in marching band and she was crying I think.
6284/Mae/And then he dumped her for Cindy a week later.
6285/Bea/Oh yeah, see that's the part I know about.
6286/Bea/That's what set off the whole nosering situation.
6287/Not Stated/I wonder what Cathy's up to now?
6288/Bea/Well, last year Ron had this ATV accident
6289/Bea/and somehow Cathy and him got to talking after that
6290/Bea/and... they got married!
6291/Mae/Huh. e_malĝojeta
6292/Bea/Yeah Ron's parents set them up out in a double wide out in Briddle
6293/Bea/since Cathy refused to end up in Possum Springs.
6294/Mae/Briddle's like... 15 minutes away.
6295/Not Stated/I wonder what Ron's doing?
6296/Bea/Uh, last year he flipped his ATV
6297/Bea/and the medical bills were really high
6298/Bea/so his parents basically had to bail him out.
6299/Mae/Yeah that'll happen. e_malĝojeta
6300/Bea/And he got talking to Cathy again and now they're married.
6301/Bea/Worked out for Ron I guess.
6302/Not Stated/I wonder what happened to Cindy?
6303/Bea/I imagine she got a new nosering.
6304/Bea/Or, conversely, never wanted a nosering ever again.
6305/Bea/You know what the worst part of this story is?
6306/Not Stated/The sordid highschool drama?
6307/Not Stated/Cindy having something ripped out of her face?
6308/Not Stated/Ron?
6309/Bea/At the time I was like
6310/Bea/"god moves things around in the strangest ways to bring two people together"
6311/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
6312/Not Stated/Hm. I guess.
6313/Bea/Well, it used to make things make more sense at least.
6314/Not Stated/I don't know if I even believe in god.
6315/Bea/Same, really.
6316/Bea/Thinking about this place- the fountain and the god-walkway and stuff...
6317/Bea/Not knowing how something worked used to seem like... magic.
6318/Bea/Now not knowing means it might be going wrong and I may not be able to fix it.
6319/Bea/Helped knowing someone was at the controls, you know?
6320/Bea/Now I'm just tired all the time from the shop.
6321/Mae/When I was at school...
6322/Bea/Yeah?
6323/Mae/Ah, don't even want to talk about it.
6324/Bea/What happened, anyway?
6325/Mae/...
6326/Mae/You want to run around the mall some more?
6327/Bea/Uh... there's not really much else to run around.
6328/Mae/We can check out the weird bad art upstairs!
6329/Mae/I wanna touch it.
6330/Bea/Please don't.
6331/Mae/I wanna run! e_ĝoja
6332/Bea/You run. I'm gonna sit here.
6333/Bea/I'm tired. And sad now.
6334/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
6335/Mae/Suit yourself.
6336/Mae/BEATRICE SANTELLO!!!
6337/Bea/Ha ha ha ha!!! Don't give them our names!
6338/Mae/...
6339/Mae/BEATRICE JONES!!!
6340/Bea/Oh wow! Is that you, god?
6341/Mae/YES! IT IS I, GOD STEVENSON
6342/Bea/I didn't know you had a last name!
6343/Mae/SILENCE, MORTAL
6344/Mae/THROUGH MY FISH MONSTER I HAVE LAIN WASTE TO YOUR KIND
6345/Bea/I'm not gonna lie- that was pretty magical.
6346/Mae/SILENCE! I SHAN'T SAY IT AGAIN!
6347/Mae/YOU AND YOUR GOOD AND NOBLE COMPANION SHALL GET ICE CREAM ON THE WAY HOME
6348/Bea/HA HA HA yeah we should probably get out of here
6349/Bea/HA HA HA HA before you're ARRESTED
6350/Bea/AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
6351/Mae/THE COPS SHALL BE CONFUSED AND STUFF AND BEAT EACH OTHER UP
6352/Mae/FOR I AM GOD, AND I HATE THE COPS
6353/Bea/Ok ok! Get down here!
6354/Mae/HAVE A GOOD ONE, MORTAL
6355/Mae/This place used to be something.
6356/Bea/I mean, it's still *something*.
6357/Mae/Nah. Just a big mostly-empty thing
6358/Mae/in a big mostly-empty parking lot.
6359/Bea/Well, you work with what you have.
6360/Mae/Let's never come here again.
6361/Bea/Don't have to convince me.
6362/Bea/I only came here because you wanted to.
6363/Mae/Well, Fort Lucenne used to be something
6364/Mae/now Fort Lucenne's over.
6365/Bea/Let's go.
6366/Bea/Let it die in peace.
6367/Mae/Let. It. Die.
6368/Mae/I wanna drive on the way home.

6377/Bea/Um... The Internet?
6378/Mae/We had the internet when we used to come here!
6379/Mae/WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAROUSEL?!
6380/Bea/Sold it I guess.
6381/Mae/WHO BUYS A CAROUSEL?!
6382/Bea/Nobody who comes here.
6383/Mae/WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BOOKSTORE?!
6384/Bea/Also the internet.
6385/Mae/WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ARCADE?!
6386/Bea/I'm going to make a sign that says "The Internet"
6387/Bea/and hold it up until you're done asking.
6388/Bea/e_malĝoja
6389/Bea/Why did I do that?
6390/Mae/e_krinĝa e_ĝoja
6391/Mae/You did so well Bea!!!
6392/Bea/I call the cops on shoplifters at my OWN STORE!
6393/Bea/This...

6396/Bea/Some kind of necklace thing?
6397/Mae/nice, nice
6398/Bea/Oh god.
6399/Not Stated/Haven't you even shoplifted before?
6400/Bea/No! Never!
6401/Mae/Ok now you're making *me* feel weird about it.
6402/Bea/...sorry?
6403/Mae/Forget it. We're home free.
6404/Bea/Really?

6427/Mae/WELL GET BACK IN THERE, CHAMP! e_ĝoja
6428/Bea/What? No.
6429/Mae/Beatrice, let me lay this out:
6430/Mae/1. The security cameras aren't even on in there.
6431/Mae/2. The cashier clearly isn't paying attention.
6432/Bea/Seemed vigilant enough for you.
6433/Mae/e_krinĝa
6434/Mae/anyway
6435/Mae/e_mira
6436/Mae/3. There is not one Mall Cop here as far as I can tell.

6461/Bea/OK OK SOMEONE'S GONNA CALL THE COPS HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
6462/Mae/wow. I completely forgot about this giant fish head.
6463/Bea/oh my god. I loved her.
6464/Mae/Did you ever come to the Summer Daze thing here?
6465/Bea/Yeah it'd like squirt people. I still have no idea how they did that.
6466/Not Stated/I always assumed it was some guy in there with a squirt gun.
6467/Bea/No, it was totally a fountain they tricked out to squirt people.
6468/Mae/That's amazing.
6469/Not Stated/One time I saw it knock a guy down.
6470/Bea/Yeah every year that would happen and someone would make a fuss.
6471/Bea/But like. I dunno.
6472/Bea/You showed up to be squirted by a fish fountain.
6473/Bea/Heh heh. You know the walkway way up there
6474/Bea/past the upper food court thing
6475/Bea/up in the atrium?
6476/Mae/The what?
6477/Bea/The ceiling. The glass part that points up.
6478/Not Stated/I know what an atrium is.
6479/Bea/uh huh
6480/Bea/anyway
6481/Not Stated/yeah?
6482/Bea/When I was a kid I thought that that's where god lived.
6483/Mae/Wow.
6484/Bea/I dunno. Just remember staring at it when I was a kid.
6485/Bea/Like, eating a burger
6486/Bea/and trying to see if I could see God
6487/Bea/like peeking over or something.
6488/Mae/Looks like they've got some weird hanging “art” up there now.
6489/Mae/Wanna go up and see?
6490/Bea/Nah, my knees are killing me from work.
6491/Mae/“Space IV: The Rocks Cosmic”
6492/Mae/“an installation by Rorford Gimms”
6493/Mae/“sponsored by Dollar Empire”
6494/Mae/“caution: do not stand on the art”
6495/Mae/Wow. This sure is the lonely end of the mall.
6496/Mae/Weird being in such a big place
6497/Mae/Alone.
6498/Mae/Huh. Thought there was more to this place.
6499/Bea/Nope.
6500/Mae/This isn’t even a mall. This is like a hallway with crap in it.
6501/Mae/Wow. Look at that big dark empty parking lot.
6502/Bea/Yeah. Not sure if it’s ever been filled.
6503/Mae/There aren’t enough people in the whole town.
6504/Bea/Probably not.
6505/Mae/It’s like a big black ocean.
6506/Bea/With a Fishtastic on the other side.
6507/Mae/Oh shiiiiiiit.
6508/Mae/I got a weird fever from eating at that Fishtastic.
6509/Mae/What a mess.
6510/Mae/I can't believe this place even has the lights on anymore.
6511/FortuneTeller/Dare you spin the wheel of destiny?
6512/Mae/Explain.
6513/FortuneTeller/None can explain the power of the wheel
6514/FortuneTeller/save that it is an unknowable circular sooth-sayer.
6515/Mae/oh snap is it gonna say the sooth?
6516/FortuneTeller/The sooth shall be said.
6517/Mae/ok I'm into this.
6518/FortuneTeller/A mighty spin! A commendable spin!
6519/FortuneTeller/Spin, spin, spin away.
6520/FortuneTeller/Your spin is... weak, my child.
6521/Mae/I'm 20.
6522/FortuneTeller/Is your arm injured?
6523/Mae/It's a little sore lately, actually.
6524/FortuneTeller/I could tell. I see all.
6525/FortuneTeller/You fortune is your future
6526/FortuneTeller/a place you will soon be
6527/FortuneTeller/forever.
6528/Mae/ok that checks out
6529/FortuneTeller/your card says much...
6530/FortuneTeller/you shall live...
6531/Mae/oh good
6532/FortuneTeller/until, alas, you die.
6533/Mae/oh.
6534/Mae/wait that was gonna happen anyway!
6535/FortuneTeller/You fortune is your future
6536/FortuneTeller/a place you will soon be
6537/FortuneTeller/forever.
6538/Mae/ok that checks out
6539/FortuneTeller/your card says much...
6540/FortuneTeller/you shall know many troubles
6541/FortuneTeller/even until the end of your days.

8096/Bea/don’t push yourself.
8097/Mae/do you know why I beat down Andy Cullen 6 years ago?
8098/Bea/no.
8099/Bea/we weren’t talking then and I thought it’d be weird to bring it up now, and...
8100/Mae/I was playing this video game. You were like dating ghosts or something.
8101/Bea/ok
8102/Mae/and I was really into it. Played it like 24-7.
8103/Mae/until this one afternoon
8104/Mae/and suddenly, like, something broke.
8105/Bea/broke?
8106/Mae/it was just like... pixels.
8107/Mae/the characters onscreen… i felt like i knew them
8108/Mae/they weren't /people/ anymore. They were just shapes.
8109/Mae/and their lines were just things someone had written
8110/Mae/they never existed, they never had feelings
8111/Mae/they never would exist, either
8112/Mae/and it felt so /sad/
8113/Mae/like i’d just lost these real people
8114/Mae/and this whole thing we had, it was just... me. Alone.
8115/Mae/and like that realization like dumped out of the screen and into real life
8116/Mae/went outside and the tree out front,
8117/Mae/I looked at it every day, it was like a friend outside the window
8118/Mae/now it was just a thing... just a thing that was there
8119/Mae/growing and eating and just /being/ there
8120/Mae/like all the stuff i felt about the tree
8121/Mae/was just in my head
8122/Mae/and there was some guy walking by
8123/Mae/and he was just shapes
8124/Mae/just like this moving bulk of... stuff
8125/Mae/and I cried
8126/Mae/because nothing was there for me anymore
8127/Mae/it was all just stuff. Stuff in the universe
8128/Mae/just... dead
8129/Bea/wow... that's... huh
8130/Mae/And the next day was that softball game
8131/Mae/and Andy was the pitcher when I was up
8132/Mae/and he was just shapes too
8133/Mae/just lines someone wrote
8134/Mae/like nothing in there
8135/Mae/and I was so scared and angry and just... I dunno
8136/Mae/before I knew it I was on top of him
8137/Mae/smashing his face in with the bat
8138/Mae/just shapes
8139/Mae/red shapes all over the grass
8140/Bea/oh my god, mae.
8141/Bea/have you talked to anyone about this?
8142/Mae/after it happened they made me go to therapy
8143/Mae/with Dr. Hank-
8144/Bea/oh gaaaaaaaawd. He’s the worst.
8145/Mae/and he made me start a journal
8146/Bea/a journal?
8147/Mae/yeah he kinda just said it would help to be able to get my thoughts down
8148/Bea/did it help?
8149/Mae/kinda? sorta?
8150/Mae/but since this whole thing happened, when I'm alone in a new place
8151/Mae/it's all shapes, like back at the softball game
8152/Mae/I was doing fine at college for a while
8153/Mae/but I couldn't make friends, I was just afraid of being outside or around people alone.
8154/Mae/And there was this statue of like the founder of something.
8155/Mae/a really shitty statue, like all rusty metal,
8156/Mae/and it was these shapes
8157/Mae/and he was pointing down at me
8158/Mae/and I was so... scared... I didn't leave my dorm room,
8159/Mae/I either didn't eat or I ate entire pizzas at once
8160/Mae/I downed cough syrup just to sleep all the time
8161/Mae/and finally I got up the courage to leave.
8162/Mae/and I came home. Where everything was fine.
8163/Mae/where I knew everyone, and it wasn't just... dead shapes.
8164/Mae/watching me.
8165/Bea/Geez.
8166/Mae/something broke. In my head. In my life.
8167/Bea/i don’t mean to be like… whatever, but
8168/Bea/it sounds like you’re suffering from some serious stuff
8169/Bea/and like, I can help you find some help for it?
8170/Mae/Dr. Hank already tried!
8171/Bea/I think Dr. Hank should stick to family medicine and dentistry
8172/Bea/and the half dozen other things he does
8173/Bea/and maybe leave the mental health services to someone else.
8174/Bea/like there are such things as depression and anxiety and like
8175/Bea/i dunno… what you’re going through, it exists.
8176/Mae/I… I thought when I came home…
8177/Mae/i just-
8178/Mae/i felt so safe here
8179/Mae/and everything made sense for a few days
8180/Mae/and then all this.
8181/Mae/and… and… and…
8182/Bea/shhhhhhh
8183/Bea/it’s gonna be okay
8184/Bea/we’ll figure this out
8185/Mae/i’m so scared
8186/Bea/i know. We’re all scared.
8187/Bea/but we’re gonna make it.
8188/Bea/you should get some sleep e_fermanta_okulojn
8189/Mae/…

8198/Gregg/yeah.
8199/Mae/do you know why I beat down Andy Cullen 6 years ago?
8200/Gregg/back then you said you went all crazy
8201/Gregg/but like that’s not really a reason i guess
8202/Mae/i was playing that game where you like dated ghosts
8203/Gregg/i remember that one. Had a hot skeleton.
8204/Gregg/Allister or something like that.
8205/Mae/heh heh yeah
8206/Mae/you were crushing hard on those dank bones.
8207/Mae/i was playing it like 24-7
8208/Mae/until this one afternoon
8209/Mae/and suddenly, like, something broke.
8210/Mae/it was just like... pixels.
8211/Gregg/your computer broke?
8212/Mae/no like… reality broke.
8213/Mae/the characters onscreen… like i’d felt like i knew them...
8214/Mae/but they weren't /people/ anymore. They were just shapes.
8215/Mae/and their lines were just things someone had written
8216/Mae/they never existed, they never had feelings
8217/Mae/they never would exist, either

8219/Mae/like i’d just lost these real people
8220/Mae/and this whole thing we had, it was just… me. Alone.
8221/Mae/and like that realization like dumped out of the screen and into real life
8222/Mae/went outside and the tree out front,
8223/Mae/I looked at it every day, it was like a friend outside the window
8224/Mae/now it was just a thing... just a thing that was there

8231/Mae/and I cried
8232/Mae/because nothing was there for me anymore
8233/Mae/it was all just stuff. Stuff in the universe
8234/Mae/just... dead
8235/Gregg/dude. Why didn’t you tell me?
8236/Mae/i don’t know. What could i have said?
8237/Mae/this all happened like the day before that softball game.
8238/Gregg/i mean i was there in the stands.
8239/Gregg/i watched you do it. I was so scared for you
8240/Mae/when Andy stepped up it was like...
8241/Mae/and he was just shapes too
8242/Mae/just lines someone wrote
8243/Mae/like nothing in there
8244/Mae/and I was so scared and angry and just... I dunno
8245/Mae/before I knew it I was on top of him
8246/Mae/smashing his face in with the bat
8247/Mae/just shapes
8248/Mae/red shapes all over the grass
8249/Gregg/there wasn’t *that* much blood
8250/Mae/oh god. I made him bleed all over the place gregg
8251/Mae/i wonder if he like wondered why
8252/Mae/what he’d done
8253/Gregg/he was probably an asshole
8254/Mae/no, dude. I didn’t know him. Neither did you.
8255/Gregg/well then you had to go to therapy
8256/Mae/yeah Dr. Hank and his journalling.
8257/Gregg/Dr. hank’s messed up one of my tooth fillings.
8258/Mae/yeah he’s not good at what he does.
8259/Mae/which i guess is understandable because he does like everything.
8260/Gregg/i meant to ask you- did that journal shit… did it actually work?
8261/Mae/kinda? Sorta?
8262/Mae/it helps me… like… grab onto things. And keep them in one place.
8263/Gregg/whoa.
8264/Mae/but since that whole thing happened back then
8265/Mae/when I'm alone in a new place
8266/Mae/it's all shapes, like back at the softball game
8267/Mae/I was doing fine at college for a while
8268/Gregg/college is for losers.
8269/Mae/dude. Listen, ok?
8270/Gregg/sorry, dude.
8271/Mae/I couldn't make friends, I was just afraid of being outside or around people alone.
8272/Mae/And there was this statue of like the founder of something.

9869/Mae/e_brako_surtalie

9871/Bea/It does look really hateable.
9872/Mae/e_mira
9873/Mae/It was like
9874/Not Stated/you were kidnapped by a cult
9875/Mae/and when they were like
9876/Mae/brainwashing you
9877/Mae/instead of some cult guy
9878/Mae/with a wavy dagger and a magic mask
9879/Bea/that’s not... ok yeah go on
9880/Mae/instead of that it was this effing pink nightmare!
9881/Bea/you were scared of it?
9882/Mae/no! I was B O R E D  T O  D E A T H.
9883/Mae/it was talking forever about like being kind to others
9884/Mae/and like i dunno helping an old neighbor do engine repair
9885/Bea/that sounds... nice?
9886/Bea/Charity Bearity Helps Old Mr. Plonko Fix His Hovercraft
9887/Mae/ugh no that’s the worst part- it ALWAYS rhymed!
9888/Bea/Charity Bearity: Pink Nightmarity.
9889/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
9890/Mae/Charity Bearity: I Just Don’t Carity
9891/Not Stated/you were under some curse

9895/Mae/sharing and not littering
9896/Mae/and paying taxes
9897/Bea/Well that’s an important... uh... skill.
9898/Mae/I WAS 5!!!

9900/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
9901/Bea/Charity Bearity Goes To A State Infrastructure Budgeting Meeting
9902/Mae/Ugh I forgot the worst part- it ALWAYS rhymed.
9903/Bea/Charity Bearity: Oh No! Austerity!
9904/Mae/What’s that?
9905/Bea/Reason the two bridges in and out of Saltztown are still closed
9906/Mae/Oh wow you still can’t like... go to Saltztown?
9907/Bea/You’re welcome to try!
9908/Bea/geez. They sure made a lot of these books.
9909/Mae/I think they’re still making them.
9910/Bea/This one looks pretty old.
9911/Mae/Charity Bearity: Danger Everywhere-ity
9912/Bea/That’s vague. And disconcerting.
9913/Mae/could’ve just kept updating that one book
9914/Bea/*sniff* *sniff*
9915/Bea/oh wow it’s dusty up here
9916/Mae/e_mira_maldekstrokule
9917/Mae/It’s *OLD* up here.
9918/Bea/sure is.
9919/Bea/maybe your... ghost? is up here.
9920/Mae/e_mira
9921/Mae/yep. ghost.
9922/Mae/or something.
9923/Mae/whatever he was,
9924/Mae/he walked through a chain link fence
9925/Mae/or flew over it
9926/Mae/or something.
9927/Mae/*while* carrying something.
9928/Bea/oh right, well that's even more impressive.
9929/Mae/so we're gonna go find this guy.
9930/Mae/because he took someone
9931/Mae/and he's like somehow connected to this thing i've been going through
9932/Mae/and that's not good.
9933/Mae/e_malĝojeta
9934/Mae/that all sounded a lot more bad-ass in my head.
9935/Bea/it's ok. it was fine.
9936/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
9937/Mae/so we’ve got some leads
9938/Mae/can I borrow your car this week?
9939/Bea/do you even have a license?
9940/Bea/I mean no, regardless, but do you?
9941/Mae/nope.
9942/Mae/no license, no credit cards, don’t believe in money
9943/Bea/you just believe in other people’s cars and money
9944/Mae/i didn’t choose to be born into this society
9945/Bea/...
9946/Bea/ok well I have, you know, a job
9947/Bea/so i can’t drive you around to all of these spots
9948/Bea/i can maybe do the graveyard?
9949/Bea/i need to go there anyway.
9950/Mae/e_ĝoja
9951/Mae/cool! I’ll see if gregg wants to do the other two.
9952/Bea/you know, like, and i probably don’t have to say this
9953/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
9954/Bea/but just because something happened in the past
9955/Bea/doesn’t mean it’s going to happen again.
9956/Mae/e_brako_surtalie
9957/Mae/Hey nerd, ever hear that history repeats?
9958/Mae/It does. It does the same thing over and over again.
9959/Bea/So we’ve just been in a loop since we were living in caves?
9960/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
9961/Mae/Yeah. That’s science.
9962/Bea/oh my freaking god.
9963/MissQuelcy/Ahem!
9964/Mae/What is...
9965/Bea/Is that Miss Quelcy?
9966/Mae/oh wow. Haven’t seen her since graduation.
9967/Bea/she was always kind of a badass.
9968/Bea/school district did not fund that art program at all.
9969/Bea/but she made it work
9970/Bea/she was like some sort of art teacher survivalist.
9971/Mae/wow. I never realized.
9972/Bea/I think they pay her in bits of string and empty soda cans.
9973/Mae/Should be saving that string to repair those bridges into Saltztown.
9974/Bea/There you go.
9975/MissQuelcy/Thank you all for coming to this second meeting
9976/MissQuelcy/Of the Possum Springs Poetry Society
9977/Bea/Do you want to stick around for this?
9978/Not Stated/Naw.
9979/Mae/e_malĝojeta
9980/Mae/public poetry performance should probably be outlawed.
9981/Bea/when have you ever seen one?
9982/Mae/school. old roommate.
9983/Bea/you’ve never mentioned your old roommate.
9984/Mae/she’s an entire story unto herself.
9985/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
9986/MissQuelcy/Excuse me, are you two staying?
9987/MissQuelcy/if so, would you like to have your conversation up here?
9988/Mae/No! To both!
9989/Mae/We’re not big into rhyming everything we say.
9990/MissQuelcy/Poetry doesn’t have to rhyme!
9991/Mae/That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
9992/Not Stated/Yeah!
9993/MissQuelcy/Tonight we have new poems from myself
9994/MissQuelcy/and "Fisherman" Jones

9997/Not Stated/she's from some big city, right?
9998/Bea/yeah
9999/Mae/how'd she end up here?
10000/Bea/who knows.
10001/Not Stated/they don't actually pay her in string, right?
10002/Bea/...
10003/Bea/Yes, Mae. They literally pay her in string.
10004/Mae/I was just joking!
10005/Bea/right.
10006/MissQuelcy/*ahem*

10029/Bea/she didn't name names.
10030/Mae/yeah she did!
10031/Bea/ok, no *full* names.

10039/Fisherman/This is called "Tunnel eels"
10040/Fisherman/Tunnel Eels, Tunnel Eels
10041/Fisherman/I do not know how it feels
10042/Fisherman/To be in darkness all the time
10043/Fisherman/Born in muck and raised in slime
10044/Fisherman/But neither d'you know paths I've trudged
10045/Fisherman/so it hardly is your place to judge.
10046/Fisherman/...
10047/Fisherman/ok that's one poem. the next one is shorter.
10048/Fisherman/This is called "Tunnel frogs"
10049/Fisherman/Tunnel Frog swims in the dark
10050/Fisherman/must think it would be a lark
10051/Fisherman/to be a fisherman like me
10052/Fisherman/but what do you know, amphibee'?
10053/Fisherman/...
10054/Fisherman/that's it.

10276/Adina/...hello?
10277/Adina/Are you there?
10278/ForestGod/You've come late.
10279/ForestGod/You are no Empress.
10280/ForestGod/Centuries have passed since I spoke to one so small and unimportant.
10281/ForestGod/It is my right to kill you.
10282/Adina/I didn't know that.
10283/ForestGod/Accept it. Death is happening always.
10284/Adina/Why should I accept it?
10285/ForestGod/It is the natural way.
10286/Adina/Funny how you decided that the way that allows you to kill me
10287/Adina/is the natural one.
10288/ForestGod/Brrrrrrrrrrrrrl.
10289/Adina/You're not a god.
10290/Adina/You're just a big animal.
10291/ForestGod/They call me a god.
10292/ForestGod/So I'm god enough.
10293/ForestGod/Tell me what was so important to say to me that you would give up your life.
10294/Not Stated/I know why you are dying.
10295/Not Stated/I know why you are sick.
10296/GodtenderBrown/Approach them with humility.
10297/GodtenderBrown/I will wait here.
10298/ForestGod/BRRRRRRRRRL.
10299/ForestGod/Sickness cannot touch me.
10300/Adina/You don't have a sickness, but you are dying.
10301/Adina/Funny, now that it's happening to you, death isn't so easy to accept, huh?
10302/ForestGod/It was Godtender Brown who told you I was weak.
10303/ForestGod/Useless, worthless.
10304/ForestGod/I will find use for him. He will feed the forest.
10305/ForestGod/The trees will find worth in him.
10306/Adina/No.
10307/Adina/Godtender Brown is a good man.
10308/Adina/He is kind and curious and warm.
10309/Adina/Even while standing out in the cold, for you.
10310/ForestGod/BRRRRRRRRL.
10311/Adina/He thinks he doesn't deserve you
10312/Adina/But you don't deserve him.
10313/Adina/And I'd rather you die never knowing what happened to you
10314/Adina/then to have you touch one hair on his head
10315/Adina/or betray his devotion.
10316/ForestGod/Why are we sick?
10317/Adina/Promise Brown will be safe. Promise on whatever is holy to you.
10318/ForestGod/I promise on myself. I promise on the 10 million mile forest.
10319/Adina/Good.
10320/ForestGod/Now swear on what is holy to you.
10321/Not Stated/I swear on the stars.
10322/Not Stated/I swear on the family you find.
10323/Not Stated/I swear on the search.
10324/ForestGod/BRRRRRRRRRL.
10325/ForestGod/I am not dying.
10326/Adina/Oh, I thought you might have accepted it.
10327/Adina/Death being always and all that.
10328/ForestGod/It was Godtender Brown who told you.
10329/ForestGod/Useless, worthless.
10330/ForestGod/I will find use for him. He will feed the forest.
10331/ForestGod/The trees will find worth in him.
10332/Adina/No.
10333/Adina/Godtender Brown is a good man.
10334/Adina/He is kind and curious and warm.
10335/Adina/Even while standing out in the cold, for you.
10336/ForestGod/BRRRRRRRRL.
10337/Adina/He thinks he doesn't deserve you
10338/Adina/But you don't deserve him.
10339/Adina/And I'd rather you die never knowing what happened to you
10340/Adina/then to have you touch one hair on his head
10341/Adina/or betray his devotion.
10342/ForestGod/Why are we dying?
10343/Adina/Promise Brown will be safe. Promise on whatever is holy to you.
10344/ForestGod/I promise on myself. I promise on the taiga, endless.
10345/Adina/Good.
10346/ForestGod/Now swear on what is holy to you.
10347/Not Stated/I swear on the stars.
10348/Not Stated/I swear on the family you find.
10349/Not Stated/I swear on the search.
10350/ForestGod/If that is what gives you hope, fine.
10351/ForestGod/Now speak.
10352/Adina/The only reason I came here is because of Godtender Brown's sadness
10353/Adina/and his love for you.
10354/Adina/But you won't survive. And now I want you to know that.
10355/ForestGod/SPEAK!!!!!
10356/Adina/The Huncher poisoned you.
10357/Adina/Obviously.
10358/ForestGod/BRRRRRRRRRRRRRL.
10359/ForestGod/There was peace! After-
10360/Adina/hundreds of years, I know.
10361/ForestGod/But why?
10362/Adina/She's a survivor.
10363/Adina/It appears you won't be.
10364/ForestGod/Then neither shall she.
10365/Adina/Ugh.
10366/Adina/You big dumb animal.
10367/ForestGod/BRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARLLLLL!!!!!
10368/Adina/Goodbye.
10369/Adina/They're gone.
10370/GodtenderBrown/They'll be back! They always are.
10371/Adina/Godtender...
10372/GodtenderBrown/Yes, Empress?
10373/Adina/You're a good man.
10374/GodtenderBrown/Thank you, I can only hope to be good.
10375/Adina/Hope is good. Whatever happens, please don't lose that.
10376/GodtenderBrown/I wish you blessings on your journey.
10377/Adina/You as well. Happy Longest Night.
10378/GodtenderBrown/Happy Longest Night to you.
10379/Mae/I'm getting sleepy, Granddad.
10380/Granddad/We're almost done, Mae.
10381/Mae/Ok good. I like the story a lot.
10382/Granddad/I knew you would.
10383/Mae/You can rob banks with me anytime.
10384/Mae/...and then she jumped off the cliff!
10385/Granddad/What? No she didn't!
10386/Mae/...and then she jumped off the cliff AGAIN!
10387/Granddad/No she DIDN'T.
10388/Mae/...and then she jumped!!
10389/Granddad/You see, this is why I read you Charity Bearity.
10390/Mae/Jump!!
10391/Granddad/*ahem*
10392/Granddad/"Charity Bearity Learns To Shareity"
10393/Mae/Jumpa-jumpa-jump!!
10394/Granddad/"In the town of Careity, there lived a little bear
10395/Granddad/named Charity Bearity."
10396/Mae/Juuuuuump!
10397/Granddad/"Charity Bearity never liked to share her toys."
10398/Mae/Oh no she jumped again!
10399/Granddad/"She wouldn't share them with the girls, she wouldn't share them with the boys."
10400/Mae/She jumped because she hates Charity Bearity!
10401/Granddad/Ugh, gonna skip ahead a few pages...
10402/Granddad/"No, she cried, I like not sharing just fine!"
10403/Granddad/"To force me to share is to say they're not mine!"
10404/Mae/She jumped because she saw a bear she could land on!
10405/Granddad/Was it Charity Bearity?
10406/Mae/Yeah! She squashed her flat!
10407/Mae/Jumpjumpjump!
10408/Granddad/"...and that's how Charity Bearity learned to share"
10409/Granddad/"...ity."
10410/Granddad/Ugh.
10411/Mae/Juuuuuuuuuuump!
10412/Granddad/This can't even be fun anymore. Aren't you getting tired!
10413/Mae/I hate Charity Bearity!
10414/Granddad/This story isn't even about Charity Bearity!
10415/Mae/Then she ju-
10416/Granddad/No. No she didn't.
10417/Granddad/She never jumped.
10418/Granddad/Do you want to hear this story or not?
10419/Mae/...yes...
10420/Granddad/I promise you'll like it.
10421/Mae/*yawn* Ok.
10422/GodtenderBrown/Hello?
10423/GodtenderBrown/Wait!
10424/Adina/Yes?
10425/GodtenderBrown/I'm truly sorry, but you cannot see the Forest God this Longest Night.
10426/Adina/Why not? I-
10427/Adina/uh... we...
10428/Adina/have already come so far for an audience!
10429/GodtenderBrown/The truth is, and you must keep this a secret, but...
10430/GodtenderBrown/but...
10431/GodtenderBrown/The Forest God is sick. They are old and dying.
10432/GodtenderBrown/And they cannot see you. It might upset them and we can't risk that.
10433/Not Stated/Sick?
10434/Not Stated/Dying?
10435/GodtenderBrown/This is the worst Longest Night ever.
10436/Adina/Hm... need to find something special for this face...
10437/Adina/...probably more in the woods, I'd reckon...
10438/GodtenderBrown/Hello traveler!
10439/Adina/Travelers!
10440/Adina/We seek an audience with the Forest God!
10441/GodtenderBrown/I am Godtender Brown. Who are you now?

10444/Adina/and our archbishop Williams.
10445/Snowdrunk/Hellllllo.
10446/Adina/We have traveled long through the night to be here, may we pass though?
10447/GodtenderBrown/Empress Astra, you say? I don't believe I am familiar with your imperial majesty!
10448/Not Stated/We come from far away, beyond the western ocean
10449/Not Stated/We come from the south, beyond this forest and the next.
10450/GodtenderBrown/Allow me!
10451/GodtenderBrown/Cross onto the Holy Mountain!

10462/Adina/A what now?
10463/GodtenderBrown/I played Glundinhorn back in my school days!
10464/Adina/Well, what a coincidence!
10465/GodtenderBrown/Is that one cursed too?

10477/GodtenderBrown/You have a *DOG* for an archbishop?
10478/Not Stated/He's extremely perceptive, right Williams?
10479/Not Stated/That is no dog! Archbishop Clancy speaks the language of beasts!

10491/Adina/A what now?
10492/GodtenderBrown/I played Glundinhorn back in my school days!
10493/Adina/Well, what a coincidence!

10514/Snowblow/*HONK!*
10515/Adina/And my Imperial Advisor, Clancy.
10516/Snowdog/*arf!*
10517/GodtenderBrown/Is that a Glundinhorn?
10518/GodtenderBrown/Your bodyguard is a dog?
10519/Not Stated/How do I know if it's a Gludinhorn?
10520/Not Stated/Yes, and Clancy is excellent at his job.
10521/Adina/Uh oh.
10522/Adina/We didn't anticipate that you would have this combination of snowmen.
10523/Adina/So... uh... sorry about that?
10524/Snowdog/*ARF!*
10525/Adina/Hello there.
10526/Snowdog/*arf!*
10527/Adina/Aw, you're a dog!
10528/Snowdog/*woof!*
10529/Adina/I'm not sure if this is really helpful, but ok.
10530/Snowdog/*pant* *pant* *pant*
10531/Adina/Your collar said "Clancy". Is that your name?
10532/Snowdog/*arf!* *arf!* *arf!*
10533/Adina/I hope you don't screw this up for me, Clancy!
10534/Adina/But I hope soon you'll be able to move on
10535/Adina/to wherever dead dogs go.
10536/Snowdog/*arf!*
10537/Adina/Ok boy, follow my lead!
10538/Snowthief/Well, that went ok.
10539/Snowthief/We doing this?
10540/Adina/Hello there.
10541/Snowthief/Ugh. What do you want?
10542/Adina/Sorry to bother you, but I need your help.
10543/Snowthief/Oh crap. I died, didn't I?
10544/Snowthief/This is so typical.
10545/Adina/Listen, by me bringing you here
10546/Adina/I think you'll be able to get out of these woods
10547/Adina/and do whatever dead people do.
10548/Snowthief/Is that something I want?
10549/Adina/I have no idea.
10550/Snowthief/Ok, whatever.
10551/Adina/Follow my lead.
10552/Snowblow/*HONK!*
10553/Adina/Hello there.
10554/Snowblow/*HONK!*
10555/Adina/Ok wow, are you just a horn?
10556/Snowblow/*HOOOOOONK!*
10557/Adina/Let's try this- honk once for yes and twice for no. Got it?
10558/Snowblow/*HONK!*
10559/Adina/Are you just a horn ghost kind of thing?
10560/Snowblow/*HONK! HONK!*
10561/Adina/Are you the person who played this horn?
10562/Snowblow/*HONK!*
10563/Adina/Listen, by bringing you back
10564/Adina/I think you'll be able to get out of these woods
10565/Adina/and do whatever dead people do.
10566/Adina/Does that sound ok?
10567/Snowblow/*HOOOOOONK!*
10568/Adina/Ok, great! Follow my lead.
10569/Snowdrunk/I can't believe I've been sober the entire time I've been dead.
10570/Snowdrunk/Let's do this. I'm not getting any less dead.
10571/Adina/Hello there.
10572/Snowdrunk/...hello?
10573/Adina/Sorry to be abrupt, but I need your help.
10574/Snowdrunk/Wait, where am I?
10575/Adina/You're on the Forest God's mountain.
10576/Snowdunk/Oh! Are we going to see the Forest God?
10577/Snowdrunk/Because I'm going to the Frozen Lake.
10578/Adina/So am I!
10579/Adina/You're not.
10580/Snowdrunk/Oh!
10581/Snowdrunk/...oh.
10582/Adina/Listen, by my bringing you here
10583/Adina/I think you'll be able to get out of these woods
10584/Adina/and do whatever dead people do.
10585/Snowdrunk/Ok, that sounds as likely as anything else that's happening.
10586/Adina/Ok, follow my lead.
10587/GodtenderBrown/Oh Empress, the Forest God is still ill.
10588/Adina/I'm so sorry.
10589/GodtenderBrown/If only I just knew why, and whether they would be well again.
10590/GodtenderBrown/I thank you for leaving your companions with me, as they have been a great comfort.
10591/Adina/No problem. I entrust them to your care.
10592/Adina/Godtender Brown!
10593/GodtenderBrown/Empress! It's so late! Why are you still here?
10594/Adina/Listen, this is very important.
10595/Adina/I know why your god is dying.
10596/GodtenderBrown/W-what?
10597/Adina/You see, I saw-
10598/GodtenderBrown/No, you must tell it to them.
10599/Adina/What? Why?
10600/GodtenderBrown/I'm not worthy of hearing of their weaknesses.
10601/GodtenderBrown/I don't deserve the peace I have found here
10602/GodtenderBrown/and I must honor them as best as my frail self will allow.
10603/Adina/That's really something.
10604/GodtenderBrown/Come with me. NOW!
10605/GodtenderBrown/This is the worst Longest Night ever.
10606/GodtenderBrown/Here's to better days.
10607/Adina/How can a god be sick?
10608/GodtenderBrown/I do not know.
10609/GodtenderBrown/If only I knew what was happening!!!!
10610/GodtenderBrown/We Godtenders are tasked with caring for the Forest God.
10611/GodtenderBrown/But this sickness, we have never seen its like.
10612/GodtenderBrown/Not in the 700 years of records kept since Saint Cecil began Tending God.
10613/Adina/Oh no.
10614/GodtenderBrown/We thought when the peace came, all would be well.
10615/Adina/The peace?
10616/GodtenderBrown/But centuries of conflict with her have weakened them.
10617/GodtenderBrown/And not long after they became ill.
10618/Adina/Her?
10619/GodtenderBrown/DO NOT SAY HER NAME HERE.
10620/GodtenderBrown/My heart is broken. My god is sick and old.
10621/GodtenderBrown/I don't know what my life would be without them.
10622/Adina/I'm sorry, Godtender.
10623/GodtenderBrown/There is nothing you can do, Empress.
10624/GodtenderBrown/As representative of the Forest Throne,
10625/GodtenderBrown/I say that no power of the Forest God shall bar your way this Longest Night.
10626/GodtenderBrown/As for [speed=.5][shake=.01]Her[/all], you are at the mercy
10627/GodtenderBrown/of the most dangerous creature in the forest.
10628/Adina/Thank you, Godtender Brown.
10629/GodtenderBrown/Go, and take a blessing with you.
10630/Adina/How can a god be dying?
10631/GodtenderBrown/I do not pretend to know the ways of such things.
10632/GodtenderBrown/If only I knew what was happening!!!!
10633/GodtenderBrown/We Godtenders are tasked with caring for the Forest God.
10634/GodtenderBrown/But this, this death, we have never seen its like.
10635/GodtenderBrown/Not in the 700 years of records kept since Saint Cecil began Tending God.
10636/Adina/Oh no.
10637/GodtenderBrown/We thought when the peace came, all would be well.
10638/Adina/The peace?
10639/GodtenderBrown/But centuries of conflict with her have weakened them.
10640/GodtenderBrown/And not long after they became ill.
10641/Adina/Her?
10642/GodtenderBrown/DO NOT SAY HER NAME HERE.
10643/GodtenderBrown/My heart is broken. My god is dying.
10644/GodtenderBrown/I don't know what my life would be without them.
10645/Adina/I'm sorry, Godtender.
10646/GodtenderBrown/There is nothing you can do, Empress.
10647/GodtenderBrown/As representative of the Forest Throne,
10648/GodtenderBrown/I say that no power of the Forest God shall bar your way this Longest Night.
10649/GodtenderBrown/As for [shake=.01]Her[/shake], you are at the mercy
10650/GodtenderBrown/of the most dangerous creature in the forest.
10651/Adina/Thank you, Godtender Brown.
10652/GodtenderBrown/Go, and take a blessing with you.
10653/GodtenderBrown/SIGNS AND WONDERS!!!!
10654/Adina/When Clancy was but a child
10655/Adina/He longed to bring peace to the beasts of the field.
10656/Snowdrunk/He sure did!
10657/Snowdog/*arf!*
10658/Adina/And he was blessed with the ability to speak to them.
10659/GodtenderBrown/Why does he not speak to us?
10660/Adina/um...
10661/Snowdrunk/hm.
10662/Not Stated/He has forgotten how, such is his dedication.
10663/Not Stated/He is currently speaking to our Imperial Hound, Dart.
10664/Snowdrunk/...
10665/Adina/Williams???
10666/Snowdrunk/Yes, this dog has a straight line through to heaven.
10667/Snowdog/*arf!*
10668/Adina/He was born with one ear that was white as the snow
10669/Adina/and that's the ear he uses to hear the celestial realms.
10670/GodtenderBrown/Amazing!
10671/Snowdog/*arf!*
10672/Snowdrunk/Yes, we are quite-
10673/Snowdog/*arf!* *arf!*
10674/Snowdrunk/-humbled in light of-
10675/Snowdog/*arf!* *arf!* *woof!* *bark!* *woof!* *arf!* *woof!* *arf!* *bark!*
10676/Snowdrunk/dear god either shut that dog up or send me back to death
10677/GodtenderBrown/What's that?
10678/Not Stated/Williams was just having an intuition!
10679/Not Stated/Clancy is receiving a vision right this moment!
10680/GodtenderBrown/Oh, you have a dog with you as well! I love dogs!
10681/GodtenderBrown/Dart! Speak, Dart!
10682/Snowdog/*arf!*
10683/GodtenderBrown/Yes Archbishop Clancy, I wish to speak with your dog!
10684/Adina/Williams! Perhaps you could... ask Dart to speak?
10685/Snowdrunk/Oh god.
10686/GodtenderBrown/Speak, Dart!
10687/Snowdrunk/Woof.
10688/Snowdog/*arf!*
10689/Snowdrunk/Bark.
10690/GodtenderBrown/Such spirit!
10691/Snowdog/*woof!*
10692/Snowdrunk/Arf.
10693/GodtenderBrown/And yet I hear the weight of many gin-soaked years in him.
10694/Adina/You are perceptive, Godtender!
10695/Snowdog/*arf!*
10696/Adina/Clancy is helping poor Dart turn his life around!
10697/Snowdrunk/I hate all of you.
10698/GodtenderBrown/What's that?
10699/Adina/The air is very cold, may we pass through?
10700/GodtenderBrown/Anyone with such a good-hearted, virtuous Archbishop
10701/GodtenderBrown/and a dog of such moral fortitude and bravery
10702/GodtenderBrown/must be worthy of inspection by the Forest God.
10703/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10704/GodtenderBrown/WHAT DEVOTION!
10705/Adina/He is a candidate for sainthood, where we come from.
10706/Snowdrunk/He is amazing, Godtender.
10707/GodtenderBrown/Beatification, while he yet lives?
10708/GodtenderBrown/Who ever has heard of such a thing?
10709/Not Stated/It's a special circumstance
10710/Not Stated/He's not alive. He's a ghost
10711/Adina/He's the secret son of the king.
10712/Snowdog/*arf!*
10713/Adina/So he's being fast-tracked to sainthood.
10714/Snowdrunk/It's all so corrupt.
10715/GodtenderBrown/That is unconscionable!
10716/Adina/Hey, you don't have to convince me!
10717/Snowdrunk/But it's not his fault.
10718/Adina/He's just a nice, sweet guy
10719/Snowdrunk/Who barks at animals
10720/Adina/...and is thus my archbishop?
10721/Snowdrunk/This was a good idea.
10722/Adina/Can we pass now?
10723/GodtenderBrown/Your dedication to this one barking holy man in your empire
10724/GodtenderBrown/has convinced me that your heart is reverent and pure.
10725/GodtenderBrown/You may pass.
10726/Adina/Thank you so much!
10727/GodtenderBrown/A GHOST?!?!?
10728/GodtenderBrown/I'm sorry, but this is too spooky for me.
10729/Adina/No, don't go!
10730/Adina/Damn it.
10731/Snowdrunk/Nice work!
10732/Snowdog/*arf!*
10733/Adina/EVERYBODY SHUT UP!
10734/Adina/Godtender Brown, are you there?
10735/GodtenderBrown/Yes?
10736/Adina/Are you afraid of one little saintly ghost?
10737/GodtenderBrown/Yes?
10738/Adina/Oh, won't you come back and let us through?
10739/GodtenderBrown/Can you promise me that your ghost will not spook me?
10740/Adina/What do you think, Williams?
10741/Snowdrunk/I believe we can do it, Empress!
10742/Snowdog/*arf!*
10743/GodtenderBrown/I will let you pass, on the condition that no one gets spooked.
10744/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10745/GodtenderBrown/Do tell, Williams!
10746/Snowdrunk/The Archbishop has spoken a blessing upon you
10747/Snowdrunk/for allowing the Empress an audience with the Forest God.
10748/GodtenderBrown/But I haven't let you pass yet!
10749/Adina/Yes, but the Archbishop is possessed of forsight!
10750/Snowdog/*arf!*
10751/Adina/He's very intuitive!
10752/GodtenderBrown/But how does he know the future is certain?
10753/Adina/He sees all possibilities and knows which one shall be!
10754/Snowdog/*arf!*
10755/GodtenderBrown/Do I really have a choice then?
10756/Snowdrunk/Sure!
10757/Adina/SHHH!
10758/Adina/No, it is fated that you shall let us pass.
10759/GodtenderBrown/I feel now like whatever happens is inevitable.
10760/Adina/But you got a blessing out of it!
10761/GodtenderBrown/I hope the blessing will help me to understand this troubling idea.
10762/Adina/May we pass?
10763/GodtenderBrown/The intuitiveness of your companions has convinced me that you are worthy to pass.
10764/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10765/GodtenderBrown/Archbishop Clancy, tell us what things you see!
10766/Snowdrunk/uh
10767/Snowdog/*arf!*
10768/Adina/Williams, care to translate?
10769/Snowdrunk/er...
10770/Snowdog/*arf!*
10771/Snowdrunk/"This blindfolded bear"
10772/GodtenderBrown/That's me!
10773/Snowdog/*arf!*
10774/Snowdrunk/"should let the Empress pass"
10775/GodtenderBrown/I can do that!
10776/Adina/Excellent! Thank you!
10777/Snowdog/*arf!*
10778/GodtenderBrown/The vision continues!
10779/Adina/um
10780/Snowdrunk/"do you have any liquor"
10781/Adina/no. stop.
10782/GodtenderBrown/What?
10783/Snowdog/*arf!*
10784/Snowdrunk/My limited skills can no longer translate.
10785/Adina/We must consign such wonders to the beasts.
10786/Adina/The badgers. The stoats. The titmice. The bear-children.
10787/GodtenderBrown/Amen.
10788/GodtenderBrown/We witnessed a miracle, on Longest Night no less.
10789/GodtenderBrown/You are most blessed, Empress.
10790/GodtenderBrown/You may pass, and I ask that you leave some of that blessing here.
10791/GodtenderBrown/Remarkable! There are other forests like this one?
10792/Adina/Well, not exactly like this...
10793/GodtenderBrown/Are there trees?
10794/Adina/Yes. It would be hard to call it a forest if there weren't trees.
10795/Snowthief/They have forests underwater.
10796/Snowdrunk/What?
10797/Snowthief/Made of seaweed.
10798/Snowthief/I seen a man drowned.
10799/Snowthief/The seaweed grabbed 'im like hair from a drowned ghost.
10800/Snowthief/Dragged 'im down.
10801/Snowdrunk/Ok.
10802/Adina/Anyway,
10803/GodtenderBrown/Oooh! I'm good and spooked now!
10804/Not Stated/We have traveled long, past many an ocean-ghost.
10805/Not Stated/Listen, that kind of thing doesn't exist.
10806/GodtenderBrown/My father was from over the western ocean.
10807/SnowThief/So am I! Small world.
10808/GodtenderBrown/...is it?
10809/SnowThief/What?
10810/GodtenderBrown/I thought I recognized that voice.
10811/SnowThief/No.
10812/GodtenderBrown/DADDY!
10813/Adina/No, he's not your father.
10814/GodtenderBrown/DADDY'S COME BACK!
10815/Not Stated/No, he really isn't your dad!
10816/Not Stated/Uh, Archbishop Williams, will you council this confused man?
10817/SnowThief/You're saying seaweed don't exist?
10818/Adina/Yes, obviously that was what I was saying.
10819/SnowThief/Well ok then, you're the expert on what exists.
10820/GodtenderBrown/I'm sorry, but we do not allow sarcasm on the Holy Mountain.
10821/Snowdrunk/Great.
10822/GodtenderBrown/What a cynical empire you must hail from.
10823/Adina/Listen, if we lay down our sarcasm, our cynicism, our irony
10824/Adina/may we cross over to see the Forest God?
10825/GodtenderBrown/Bring not one word of insincerity here!
10826/GodtenderBrown/And you may pass. But watch yourself.
10827/Adina/Thank you Godtender!
10828/GodtenderBrown/I am afraid of ghosts
10829/GodtenderBrown/and the ocean
10830/GodtenderBrown/and horses, but I feel that's not relevant here.
10831/Adina/Fair enough. Those are all scary things.
10832/Adina/Even in my duties as an Empress,
10833/Adina/the horrors of ghosts, the ocean, and horses.
10834/Snowthief/The big three.
10835/Snowdrunk/Horrifying.
10836/Adina/May we pass?
10837/GodtenderBrown/You have endured many terrors in your travels,
10838/GodtenderBrown/but our shared fears can not harm us
10839/GodtenderBrown/in the domain of the Forest God.
10840/GodtenderBrown/You may pass.
10841/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10842/Snowdrunk/Why are you so ready to assume a stranger is your father?
10843/Snowdrunk/It seems there's something there you need to deal with.
10844/GodtenderBrown/Ever since daddy got kicked in the head by that horse
10845/Snowthief/Do what now?
10846/GodtenderBrown/daddy was always a trickster
10847/GodtenderBrown/so maybe he isn't dead after all, and this is just the longest joke he ever pulled.
10848/Adina/...
10849/Snowthief/That's commitment.
10850/GodtenderBrown/But you're right.
10851/GodtenderBrown/And all these years of waiting, and hoping, and hating all horses...
10852/Adina/I feel like we've all learned something tonight.
10853/Snowdrunk/Bless you, my children.
10854/Adina/May we pass?
10855/GodtenderBrown/You are a wise man, Archbishop Williams
10856/GodtenderBrown/and you are an insightful Empress, Astra.
10857/GodtenderBrown/you may pass.
10858/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10859/GodtenderBrown/Daddy was such a trickster.
10860/GodtenderBrown/Ever since the day he got kicked in the head by that horse
10861/GodtenderBrown/I've hoped this was just a very, very long joke.
10862/Snowthief/You're kidding!
10863/GodtenderBrown/Naive, I know...
10864/Snowthief/No, I mean my mother was kicked in the head by a horse!
10865/GodtenderBrown/huh!
10866/Adina/Guys, my sister was kicked in the head by a horse.
10867/GodtenderBrown/Wow!
10868/Snowdrunk/My uncle was killed when a statue of a badger fell on him!
10869/Snowdrunk/But I guess that isn't relevant here.
10870/Adina/We've all lost so much because of horses.
10871/GodtenderBrown/We are bound together by it.
10872/Adina/May we pass?
10873/GodtenderBrown/This moment we have shared, it is precious to me.
10874/GodtenderBrown/And I feel as though you are good people who hate horses.
10875/GodtenderBrown/You may pass.
10876/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10877/GodtenderBrown/Glundinhorns hold the curse of eventual death for all who play them.
10878/Adina/Wow.
10879/GodtenderBrown/and extreme misfortune for all who hear them.
10880/Snowblow/*Hoooooooooonk.*
10881/Snowdrunk/Clearly.
10882/Not Stated/And they let you play this in school?
10883/Not Stated/But you're still alive?
10884/GodTenderBrown/They didn't discover the curse until after I had acheived wisdom.
10885/GodTenderBrown/The year they did the all Gludinhorn Midsummer Chorale.
10886/GodTenderBrown/And the school fell into the earth.
10887/Adina/Oh my god!
10888/Snowblow/*HONK!!!*
10889/Snowdrunk/Yeah that'll be a curse alright.
10890/GodtenderBrown/And now you are cursed, for you have heard the Gludinhorn!
10891/GodtenderBrown/And your poor herald is cursed with eventual death!
10892/Snowdrunk/Oh no. Not that.
10893/Snowblow/*Hooooooooonk.*
10894/GodtenderBrown/Oh Stanislaus Glundin! The pain your horn has caused!
10895/Adina/Please allow us to seek the wisdom of the Forest God
10896/Adina/in regards to the cursed misfortunes myself and Imperial Advisor Willaims now anticipate.
10897/GodtenderBrown/We share a curse. How can I refuse.
10898/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10899/GodtenderBrown/The curse is eventual death. My days are numbered.
10900/Adina/But that's...
10901/Snowdrunk/That's just being mortal.
10902/Snowblow/*Honk!*
10903/GodtenderBrown/Yes, I'll never be immortal now.
10904/Adina/Was that a possibility before?
10905/GodtenderBrown/Who knows how these things work?
10906/Snowdrunk/...
10907/GodtenderBrown/The boy who sat in front in of me in the ensemble
10908/GodtenderBrown/He heard my Glundinhorn thrice weekely.
10909/GodtenderBrown/He suffered great misfortune when his horse kicked my father in the head.
10910/Adina/Good god!
10911/GodtenderBrown/My father had played the GlundinHorn before me.
10912/GodtenderBrown/Oh Stanislaus Glundin! The pain your horn has caused!
10913/Adina/Please allow us to seek the wisdom of the Forest God
10914/Adina/in regards to the cursed misfortunes myself and Imperial Advisor Willaims now anticipate.
10915/GodtenderBrown/We share a curse. How can I refuse.
10916/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10917/GodtenderBrown/Glundinhorns hold the curse of eventual death for all who play them.
10918/Adina/Really?
10919/GodtenderBrown/and extreme misfortune for all who hear them.
10920/Snowblow/*Hoooooooooonk.*
10921/Snowthief/Shocking.
10922/Not Stated/Yeah, you're kidding, right?
10923/Not Stated/But you're still alive?
10924/GodtenderBrown/I would never kid about the curse that took daddy away.
10925/Snowthief/ugh... "daddy"
10926/Adina/I'm sorry to hear of your father's death, Godtender!
10927/GodtenderBrown/It was his Gludinhorn that I played.
10928/GodtenderBrown/We shared the doom of eventual death, which is something to share indeed.
10929/Snowblow/*Hoooooonk.*
10930/GodtenderBrown/But praise the Forest God. In the church I found a new family.
10931/Snowblow/*Honk!*
10932/Adina/That is lovely.
10933/GodtenderBrown/I'm not seeking to replace my father, but I've made so many friends.
10934/GodtenderBrown/Father Carmel, Father Perpa, Father Patience Forget-Not-God...
10935/Adina/*urk*
10936/Snowthief/I'm sorry can we talk about how no one should use the word "daddy"?
10937/Adina/Godtender, in recognition of the family you find when your family is gone,
10938/Adina/may we bring out cares and curses to the Forest God?
10939/GodtenderBrown/We share the curse of this horn, which has taken so much,
10940/GodtenderBrown/and will take more still.
10941/GodtenderBrown/you may pass.
10942/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10943/GodtenderBrown/The dread curse of the Gludinhorn is the ever-present shadow of death
10944/GodtenderBrown/and one day, perhaps tomorrow, perhaps when you are old
10945/GodtenderBrown/it will find you.
10946/SnowThief/How unnatural.
10947/SnowHorn/*Hoooooonk.*
10948/Adina/That's not really a curse in the classic sense.
10949/GodtenderBrown/It kills you! How much worse can it be?
10950/Adina/Were you expecting to live forever before you played the horn?
10951/GodtenderBrown/Who knows, nothing is certain.
10952/SnowThief/Well, at least one thing is.
10953/GodtenderBrown/Someday we must all hear the horn, we who have heard the horn.
10954/Adina/Godtender, may we bring our cares and curses to the Forest God?
10955/GodtenderBrown/We all share a doom. A horn-doom.
10956/GodtenderBrown/How can I deny my doom-mates?
10957/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10958/GodtenderBrown/Brass? Twisted around? Blow into one end?
10959/Adina/That's most horns I think.
10960/GodtenderBrown/Well, you can tell after the fact, because GludinHorns are cursed.
10961/Snowhorn/*HONK?!*
10962/Adina/What?!
10963/GodtenderBrown/The Gludinhorn curses all who hear it to misfortune,
10964/GodtenderBrown/and those who play it to eventual death.
10965/Snowhorn/*Hooooooooonk.*
10966/Adina/I don't think that'll be a problem here.
10967/Snowdog/*Hooooooowl!*
10968/GodtenderBrown/My father was a Gludinhorn player, as was I
10969/GodtenderBrown/And now death lies in my future.
10970/Adina/Isn't that the case for all of us?
10971/GodtenderBrown/Who even knows what would have happened.
10972/Adina/I have to say, probably death.
10973/GodtenderBrown/Who even knows.
10974/Adina/May we pass?
10975/GodtenderBrown/We have so much in common.
10976/GodtenderBrown/We are all cold, and all of us will someday die
10977/GodtenderBrown/or in your case, suffer great misfortune.
10978/GodtenderBrown/You may pass.
10979/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
10980/GodtenderBrown/How does this relationship work?
10981/Adina/He is highly intuitive.
10982/Snowhorn/*HONK!*
10983/Snowdog/*arf!*
10984/Adina/No, he barks once for yes, and twice for no.
10985/GodtenderBrown/Oh! Ask him a question!!!!
10986/Adina/Um...
10987/Adina/Clancy, will Godtender Brown allow us passage?
10988/Snowdog/*arf!*
10989/Adina/Hey, look!
10990/GodtenderBrown/Amazing!
10991/Snowdog/*arf!* *arf!*
10992/GodtenderBrown/What does this mean?
10993/Adina/He's just excited.
10994/GodtenderBrown/That is understandable.
10995/GodtenderBrown/Are you excited to meet the Forest God, Clancy?
10996/Snowdog/*arf!* *arf!*
10997/GodtenderBrown/Wait, that was twice for no, right?
10998/Snowblow/*HONK!*
10999/Snowdog/*arf!* *arf!*
11000/Adina/I think that makes it a double negative.
11001/GodtenderBrown/He's not not excited to meet the Forest God?
11002/GodtenderBrown/Then I am not not not letting you pass!
11003/Adina/So that's... a triple...
11004/GodtenderBrown/No, I meant not not not not. Quadruple!
11005/Snowdog/*arf!*
11006/Adina/Can we pass?
11007/GodtenderBrown/Your willingness to seek council among even the beasts
11008/GodtenderBrown/says volumes about your wisdom and devotion to your people.
11009/GodtenderBrown/You may pass.
11010/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
11011/GodtenderBrown/Hello?
11012/GodtenderBrown/Please do not unnecessarily ring the red bell!
11013/Adina/Hello!
11014/GodtenderBrown/Hello traveler!
11015/GodtenderBrown/And who are you?
11016/Adina/Adina! An astronomer! I seek an audience with the Forest God!
11017/GodtenderBrown/I'm sorry, Adina, but the Forest God will not entertain you.
11018/GodtenderBrown/Kings, emperors, ones of high import
11019/GodtenderBrown/only those am I permitted to allow through.
11020/Adina/But I'm important! I'm an... empress!
11021/GodtenderBrown/I may wear a blindfold, but I can hear that you are alone.
11022/GodtenderBrown/And no empress would travel alone.
11023/GodtenderBrown/This is highly improper.
11024/Adina/This is highly annoying.
11025/GodtenderBrown/If you are indeed an empress, bring your entourage here
11026/GodtenderBrown/and we shall discuss the situation.
11027/GodtenderBrown/Until then, have a pleasant Longest Night!
11028/Adina/...thanks...
11029/GodtenderBrown/I still can't hear your companions.
11030/Adina/O-oh, they'll be right along in a minute...
11031/Snowdrunk/...
11032/Adina/Eimhin???
11033/Snowthief/Oh yeah, this dog barks straight at god.
11034/Snowdog/*arf!*
11035/Adina/He was born with one ear that was white as the snow
11036/Adina/and that's the ear he uses to hear the celestial realms.
11037/GodtenderBrown/Amazing!
11038/Snowdog/*arf!*
11039/Snowthief/Yeah, he's pretty-
11040/Snowdog/*arf!* *arf!*
11041/Snowdrunk/-great for a-
11042/Snowdog/*arf!* *arf!* *woof!* *bark!* *woof!* *arf!* *woof!* *arf!* *bark!*
11043/Snowthief/I am going to kick this mutt right off this cliff.
11044/GodtenderBrown/What's that?
11045/Not Stated/Eimhin was just having an intuition!
11046/Not Stated/Clancy is receiving a vision right this moment!
11047/GodtenderBrown/SIGNS AND WONDERS!!!!
11048/Adina/When Clancy was but a child
11049/Adina/He longed to bring peace to the beasts of the field.
11050/Snowthief/Yep. Beasts of the field. That's what he did.
11051/Snowdog/*arf!*
11052/Adina/And he was blessed with the ability to speak to them.
11053/GodtenderBrown/Why does he not speak to us?
11054/Snowthief/He's profoundly stupid?
11055/Adina/Stupid with wisdom, that is!
11056/GodtenderBrown/What?
11057/Not Stated/He has forgotten how to speak, such is his dedication.
11058/Not Stated/He is currently speaking to our Imperial Hound, Dart.
11059/GodtenderBrown/WHAT DEVOTION!
11060/Adina/He is a candidate for sainthood, where we come from.
11061/Snowthief/It's a very low bar to hurdle.
11062/GodtenderBrown/Beatification, while he yet lives?
11063/GodtenderBrown/Who ever has heard of such a thing?
11064/Not Stated/It's a special circumstance
11065/Not Stated/He's not alive. He's a ghost
11066/GodtenderBrown/Oh, you have a dog with you as well! I love dogs!
11067/GodtenderBrown/Dart! Speak, Dart!
11068/Snowdog/*arf!*
11069/GodtenderBrown/Yes Archbishop Clancy, I wish to speak with your dog!
11070/Adina/Eimhin! Perhaps you could... ask Dart to speak?
11071/Snowthief/Uuuuuuuuugghhhh.
11072/GodtenderBrown/Speak, Dart!
11073/Snowthief/Woof.
11074/Snowdog/*arf!*
11075/Snowthief/Bark.
11076/GodtenderBrown/Such spirit!
11077/Snowdog/*woof!*
11078/Snowthief/Arf.
11079/GodtenderBrown/And yet I hear an unearned cynicism in his voice.
11080/Adina/You are perceptive, Godtender!
11081/Snowdog/*arf!*
11082/Adina/Clancy is helping poor Dart turn his life around!
11083/Snowthief/I was having such a great day, being dead...
11084/GodtenderBrown/What's that?
11085/Adina/The air is very cold, may we pass through?
11086/GodtenderBrown/Anyone with such a good-hearted, virtuous Archbishop
11087/GodtenderBrown/and a dog of such moral fortitude and bravery
11088/GodtenderBrown/must be worthy of inspection by the Forest God.
11089/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
11090/GodtenderBrown/Do tell, Eimhin!
11091/Snowthief/The Archbishop says good job on letting us pass.
11092/GodtenderBrown/But I haven't yet!
11093/Adina/Yes, but the Archbishop is possessed of forsight!
11094/Snowdog/*arf!*
11095/Adina/He's very intuitive!
11096/GodtenderBrown/But how does he know the future is certain?
11097/Adina/He sees all possibilities and knows which one shall be!
11098/Snowdog/*arf!*
11099/Adina/it is fated that you shall let us pass.
11100/GodtenderBrown/I feel now like whatever happens is inevitable.
11101/Adina/But you got a "good job" out of it!
11102/GodtenderBrown/I hope this blessing will help me to understand this troubling idea.
11103/Snowthief/Don't strain yourself.
11104/Adina/May we pass?
11105/GodtenderBrown/The intuitiveness of your companions has convinced me that you are worthy to pass.
11106/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
11107/GodtenderBrown/Archbishop Clancy, tell us what things you see!
11108/Snowthief/uh
11109/Snowdog/*arf!*
11110/Adina/Eimhin, care to translate?
11111/Snowthief/Sure.
11112/Snowdog/*arf!*
11113/Snowthief/"This blindfolded oaf"
11114/GodtenderBrown/That's me! I am such an oaf!
11115/Snowdog/*arf!*
11116/Snowthief/"should let the Empress pass"
11117/GodtenderBrown/I can do that!
11118/Adina/Excellent! Thank you!
11119/Snowdog/*arf!*
11120/GodtenderBrown/The vision continues!
11121/Adina/um
11122/Snowthief/"Beware the horn, beware the horse"?
11123/Adina/What?
11124/GodtenderBrown/What!?
11125/Snowdog/*arf!*
11126/Snowthief/I think I actually had something there for a minute.
11127/Adina/We must consign such wonders to the beasts.
11128/Adina/The badgers. The stoats. The titmice. The bear-children.
11129/GodtenderBrown/Amen.
11130/GodtenderBrown/We witnessed a miracle, on Longest Night no less.
11131/GodtenderBrown/You are most blessed, Empress.
11132/GodtenderBrown/You may pass, and I ask that you leave some of that blessing here.
11133/GodtenderBrown/A GHOST?!?!?
11134/GodtenderBrown/I'm sorry, but this is too spooky for me.
11135/Adina/No, don't go!
11136/Adina/Damn it.
11137/Snowthief/Wow. What a wuss.
11138/Snowthief/Hey, you sure did screw that up!
11139/Snowdog/*arf!*
11140/Adina/EVERYBODY SHUT UP!
11141/Adina/Godtender Brown, are you there?
11142/GodtenderBrown/Yes?
11143/Adina/Are you afraid of one little saintly ghost?
11144/GodtenderBrown/Yes?
11145/Adina/Oh, won't you come back and let us through?
11146/GodtenderBrown/Can you promise me that your ghost will not spook me?
11147/Adina/What do you think, Eimhin?
11148/SnowthiefBrown/Yeah I have my anti-spooking hat on or whatever.
11149/Snowdog/*arf!*
11150/GodtenderBrown/I will let you pass, on the condition that no one gets spooked.
11151/Adina/Thank you, Godtender!
11152/Adina/He's the secret son of the king.
11153/Snowdog/*arf!*
11154/Adina/So he's being fast-tracked to sainthood.
11155/Snowthief/Seriously. Totally hecked up.
11156/GodtenderBrown/That is unconscionable!
11157/Adina/Hey, you don't have to convince me!
11158/Snowthief/But listen, it's not his fault.
11159/Adina/He's just a nice, sweet guy
11160/Snowthief/Who barks at animals
11161/Adina/...and is thus my archbishop?
11162/Snowthief/*sigh*
11163/Adina/Can we pass now?
11164/GodtenderBrown/Your dedication to this one barking holy man in your empire
11165/GodtenderBrown/has convinced me that your heart is reverent and pure.
11166/GodtenderBrown/You may pass.
11167/Adina/Thank you so much!
11168/Adina/That's a blindfold, right?
11169/GodtenderBrown/It's a blinder.
11170/Adina/Why do you wear it?
11171/GodtenderBrown/Someone may steal the image of the Forest God
11172/GodtenderBrown/from where it was reflected in my eyes
11173/GodtenderBrown/and it would be a blasphemy to do such a thing.
11174/Not Stated/Is that a common problem?
11175/Not Stated/Aren't you worried about falling off this mountain?
11176/GodtenderBrown/I walk by faith, and my steps are made sure by the Forest God.
11177/Adina/Well, I guess you're still here.
11178/GodtenderBrown/See?
11179/GodtenderBrown/A wind demon once stole the reflection from a Godtender's Eyes.
11180/GodtenderBrown/And placed it on the surface of a mirror.
11181/GodtenderBrown/To convince a king that he was a god.
11182/Adina/Why?
11183/GodtenderBrown/The king jumped from a high tower, thinking he could fly.
11184/GodtenderBrown/And the demon entered his broken body
11185/GodtenderBrown/And ruled his kingdom for 99 years
11186/GodtenderBrown/until he was driven out by Saint Balfa and the Charmed Goat.
11187/Adina/So the wind demon was just a jerk then.
11188/GodtenderBrown/It's a demon. What are you gonna do?
11189/Adina/Where is everyone?
11190/GodtenderBrown/They are in the hills performing Longest Night services.
11191/GodtenderBrown/They will be back by dawn.
11192/Adina/Why aren't you with them?
11193/GodtenderBrown/Oh, I don't have a congregation.
11194/GodtenderBrown/It is my job to meet pilgrims at the chasm.
11195/Adina/Godtender, can I ask a personal question?
11196/GodtenderBrown/Of course.
11197/Not Stated/What does all of this do for you?
11198/Not Stated/Aren't you very, very, very cold?
11199/Adina/Oh no. Poor Stevenson...
11200/Adina/Looks like this thing took a beating from something huge, so...
11201/Adina/I wonder if there's a head in there?
11202/Adina/...
11203/Adina/Not checking.
11204/Mae/Why wouldn't she check?
11205/Mae/I would.
11206/Granddad/So would I.
11207/Mae/If I ever find a body part on the ground
11208/Mae/I am gonna poke it with a stick.
11209/Granddad/Can't argue with you there.
11210/Adina/Poor Stevenson.
11211/Snowdrunk/Oh hello.
11212/Adina/Hey! Thanks for helping me out back there!
11213/Snowdrunk/Thanks for helping me get out of here.
11214/Adina/How did you end up here, anyway?
11215/Snowdrunk/He was dead.
11216/Snowdrunk/I was drunk.
11217/Snowdrunk/The frozen lake was east.
11218/Snowdrunk/And then I was dead too.
11219/Adina/Oh.
11220/Snowdrunk/Kinda nice up here. Peaceful.
11221/Snowdrunk/...
11222/Adina/Oh, you're already gone, huh?
11223/Snowdrunk/...
11224/Adina/I hope you're going someplace better.
11225/Adina/Thanks.
11226/Adina/Hey you!
11227/Snowthief/Hey YOU!
11228/Adina/So, who are you?
11229/Snowthief/I was an exceptional thief.
11230/Adina/How did you end up in the forest?
11231/Snowthief/I was going to rob the Huncher.
11232/Snowthief/She's been there forever.
11233/Snowthief/She's got to have loads of priceless crap.
11234/Adina/How did that go?
11235/Snowthief/I remember reaching up, trying to grab the sun
11236/Snowthief/as the snow covered me.
11237/Snowthief/You do dumb half-asleep things when you die.
11238/Adina/Huh.
11239/Snowthief/There's your deep insight on the dying process.
11240/Adina/Appreciate it.
11241/Snowthief/I'm bored.
11242/Snowthief/...she's got it...
11243/Adina/She's got what?
11244/Snowthief/It was a lock and a key. Only one set like them.
11245/Adina/Yeah?
11246/Snowthief/...
11247/Adina/Hello?
11248/Snowthief/...
11249/Adina/thanks, thiefy.
11250/Adina/i never said- thanks for the arm.
11251/GodtenderBrown/The blessing of the Forest God goes with you.
11252/GodtenderBrown/Hm.
11253/Adina/Sorry, is that a weird question?
11254/GodtenderBrown/No, not at all.
11255/GodtenderBrown/I think it gives me a truth I can't find anywhere else.
11256/GodtenderBrown/And one I have to find every day when I wake up.
11257/GodtenderBrown/Like, it's there, but I don't have a map to it.
11258/GodtenderBrown/and looking for it is where I find everything else.
11259/Adina/Wait, but isn't the Forest God in there right now?
11260/Adina/Where is the mystery in what you're looking for?
11261/GodtenderBrown/The Forest God does not behave as I always expect
11262/GodtenderBrown/and the difference between my expectations and reality
11263/GodtenderBrown/is mystery enough.
11264/Adina/Fair enough. Thank you.
11265/GodtenderBrown/You are quite welcome.
11266/GodtenderBrown/I can only hope that the Forest God may heal.
11267/GodtenderBrown/ha ha ha ha ha!
11268/GodtenderBrown/I am from the country of giants!
11269/GodtenderBrown/I am wearing the thickest of coats
11270/GodtenderBrown/and the warmest of our Godtender hats.
11271/GodtenderBrown/there isn't a chill frosty enough to touch these bones.
11272/Adina/ha ha ha. ok.
11273/GodtenderBrown/Aren't you cold?
11274/Adina/Yes. Freezing. Thanks.
11275/Mae/And then she jumped over the kazm!
11276/Granddad/It's "chasm," and no she didn't.
11277/Mae/Why not?
11278/Granddad/The gap was too wide. She would have never made it.
11279/Mae/But she totally cou-
11280/Granddad/That's not how it happened.
11281/Mae/She jumped across!
11282/Granddad/No she didn't.
11283/Mae/She was an expert ski jumper. She could have made it across easily!
11284/Granddad/She wasn't. They didn't have skiing back then.
11285/Mae/What did they have?
11286/Granddad/Slidey-snowshoes.
11287/Mae/She jumped across with her slidey-snowshoes!
11288/Granddad/Mae.
11289/Mae/Granddad.
11290/Granddad/Anyway...
11291/Mae/She jumped across anyway!
11292/Granddad/No, the gap was too wide.
11293/Mae/No it wasn't! I can see it.
11294/Granddad/Well I can see it too and it's my story.
11295/Mae/If you can say she couldn't I can say she could!
11296/Granddad/Ugggggh...
11297/Mae/She jumped because it's my story now!
11298/Granddad/Ok then. She jumped across
11299/Granddad/and I don't know what happened after that.
11300/Mae/Aw.
11301/Granddad/I thought it was your story now?
11302/Mae/Well...
11303/Granddad/Maybe the story is both of ours?
11304/Mae/That sounds good.
11305/Granddad/How about we work together?
11306/Mae/Ok.
11307/Granddad/So anyway, she couldn't jump over the cliff...
11308/Mae/FIIIIIIIIIIINE.
11309/Mae/And then... oh right. She didn't jump.
11310/Granddad/Thank you, Mae.
11311/Adina/Hey cat. Figured I'd see you here.
11312/TreeCat/You figured right.
11313/Adina/You figured wrong.
11314/TreeCat/How's that?
11315/Adina/I didn't die in there.
11316/TreeCat/So you didn't.
11317/TreeCat/But then again, I've never died in there either.
11318/TreeCat/So pardon me if I'm not overly impressed you did it once.
11319/Adina/You are such an ass.
11320/TreeCat/You certainly caused a lot of trouble tonight.
11321/Adina/I didn't mean to. Just passing through.
11322/TreeCat/Isn't that always the way.
11323/Not Stated/I have to go now.
11324/Not Stated/So who are you, really?
11325/Astronomer/You know, I doubted you would make it.
11326/Adina/A promise is a promise.
11327/Astronomer/How is home?
11328/Adina/Same as ever. Colder now of course.
11329/Adina/The sheep shut down the 5th street bridge again on Longest Night eve.
11330/Astronomer/Ha ha ha!
11331/Adina/The farmers were there all day trying to pull them off.
11332/Astronomer/Have they figured out why they keep doing that?
11333/Adina/No one has a clue.
11334/Astronomer/Hm.
11335/Adina/I know you can't stay long.
11336/Astronomer/I can't. So ask.
11337/Adina/Ok, did you find the ghost star?
11338/Astronomer/I did, my first night dead.
11339/Astronomer/It's there.
11340/Adina/Oh my god.
11341/Astronomer/Something like that.
11342/Astronomer/Will you remember where that is?
11343/Adina/Yes.
11344/Adina/It's funny.
11345/Astronomer/What is?
11346/Adina/It's always been there.
11347/Adina/I just had no way of seeing it.
11348/Astronomer/You still can't, not really.
11349/Astronomer/But you can chart where it is.
11350/Astronomer/That's something at least.
11351/Adina/Wow.
11352/Adina/I feel like just a few feet away
11353/Adina/there's this thing, bigger than I can think about,
11354/Adina/burning away. Exploding.
11355/Adina/And between us is this sheet of black.
11356/Adina/And when I think about it I feel like I'm going to overflow.
11357/Astronomer/I think about this a lot these days.
11358/Astronomer/We devote ourselves to something we barely understand,
11359/Astronomer/something we can never touch.
11360/Astronomer/We give it a name, and we give ourselves a name for doing so.
11361/Astronomer/All of it creates this connection.
11362/Astronomer/And that connection, that becomes the thing we can touch.
11363/Astronomer/You appreciate those connections even more after you've died.
11364/Adina/I'm gonna miss you all over again now.
11365/Astronomer/Well, on the bright side, you got a star out of it.
11366/Adina/That's something, at least.
11367/Astronomer/Ha ha ha.
11368/Astronomer/Pretty amazing to be something, at least.
11369/Adina/Yeah.
11370/Astronomer/Goodbye, Astronomer.
11371/Adina/Goodbye, Astronomer.
11372/Granddad/The End.
11373/Mae/What constellation was it?
11374/Granddad/No one knows. It's lost to history.
11375/Mae/Did this really happen?
11376/Granddad/Does it matter if it really happened?
11377/Mae/I think it does.
11378/Granddad/Well, we'll never know.
11379/Granddad/But hearing it happened to you.
11380/Granddad/And that's something.
11381/Mae/Something something something.
11382/Mae/I want to find that constellation.
11383/Granddad/Go outside some night and find it.
11384/Granddad/and tell me where it is, ok?
11385/Mae/*yawn*
11386/Granddad/You look tuckered out, kid.
11387/Mae/I am.
11388/Granddad/I'll leave you to it.
11389/Granddad/sweet dreams, kiddo.
11390/Mae/zzz
11391/TreeCat/The Huncher, her child, the Forest God- those aren't your business.
11392/Adina/I know.
11393/TreeCat/Leave all of that here. You were in their forest.
11394/Adina/I'm an astronomer.
11395/Adina/It may be their forest, but it's under my sky.
11396/TreeCat/ha ha ha. i bet that sounded great in your head.
11397/Adina/It sounded great when I said it, asscat.
11398/TreeCat/Goodbye, Adina The Astronomer. Good luck.
11399/Adina/Goodbye, Cat. Happy Longest Night.
11400/TreeCat/Pardon?
11401/Adina/You some magical cat? Cat god? Cat wizard? Something?
11402/TreeCat/I'm just a cat.
11403/TreeCat/I live near the woods.
11404/TreeCat/I like shiny things.
11405/TreeCat/And I listen.
11406/Adina/Oh.
11407/TreeCat/Your turn. Who are you?
11408/Not Stated/I'm an astronomer.
11409/Not Stated/I'm a survivor.
11410/Adina/I'm here because there's something missing in the sky.
11411/Adina/And this is where I'll find it.
11412/TreeCat/Are you sure?
11413/Adina/At this point I'm so exhausted and cold
11414/Adina/that I can't afford to not be sure.
11415/TreeCat/That's either very sad or very beautiful.
11416/Adina/It's very true.
11417/Adina/I'm freezing.
11418/TreeCat/Prrrrr.
11419/Adina/Where I come from, where I was tonight.
11420/Adina/I've survived.
11421/TreeCat/Survival is good.
11422/TreeCat/Steal Everything. Never get caught.
11423/TreeCat/Eat rats. Find the warmest barn.
11424/Adina/Not how I'd put it, but yes.
11425/TreeCat/How would you put it?
11426/Adina/Just get through the damn forest.
11427/Adina/I like the stars. They're out there hanging in black.
11428/Adina/Mawkish, yeah.
11429/Adina/The darker it gets...
11430/TreeCat/Prrrr.
11431/TreeCat/Prrrr.
11432/Adina/Travis?!? What are *you* doing here?
11433/Astronomer/How do you even know who I am?
11434/Mae/And then Travis told her off...
11435/Granddad/Who's Travis?
11436/Mae/This really annoying kid at school.
11437/Granddad/Why would this Travis character exist in the past?
11438/Mae/Because he stole a time machine.
11439/Granddad/Right, right.
11440/Mae/Anyways, so then Travis said...
11441/Astronomer/...I stole a time machine and that's why I'm here to annoy you.
11442/Adina/O-okay.
11443/Astronomer/So. You should be annoyed.
11444/Adina/Yeah. You're pretty annoying.
11445/Adina/Welp.
11446/Astronomer/Have a good one.
11447/Adina/cya later
11448/TreeCat/Talk to me again.
11449/HuncherOutside/Who's that walking on my porch?
11450/Adina/Hello?
11451/HuncherOutside/Oh girl, it's all over now.
11452/HuncherInside/There are old bodies in the north.
11453/HuncherInside/Where the ground never thaws.
11454/HuncherInside/Frozen in the dirt and ice for millenia.
11455/HuncherInside/In some of them there is a sickness against which we are no longer strong.
11456/HuncherInside/Someday the earth will warm, and the ice will melt.
11457/HuncherInside/And that sickness will finish the work on us
11458/HuncherInside/that began when we were first born.
11459/Adina/...
11460/HuncherInside/KID! Will you please stop that honking?
11461/HuncherKid/Nope.
11462/HuncherInside/Fine, kid, fine.
11463/HuncherInside/I'm going to leave you where they'll never find you.
11464/HuncherKid/Ha ha ha.
11465/Not Stated/I'm sorry, am I interrupting something?
11466/Not Stated/I need to get to the Frozen Lake.
11467/HuncherInside/Stop.
11468/Adina/UGHK!
11469/Adina/I can't move. This hurts. Stop.
11470/HuncherInside/Come no closer.
11471/HuncherInside/Stop.
11472/Adina/UGHK!
11473/Adina/!!!
11474/Adina/Here she comes...
11475/Adina/I need somewhere to hide!
11476/Adina/To the brambles!
11477/Adina/Ready!
11478/HuncherOutside/Damn Squirrels!
11479/HuncherOutside/Damn Squirrels won't take a break.
11480/HuncherOutside/Squirrels?
11481/HuncherOutside/Squirrels.
11482/HuncherOutside/North wind, black wind, wolf in the dark!
11483/HuncherOutside/Ugh, this weather never behaves.
11484/HuncherOutside/Gotta say the whole damn thing every time.
11485/HuncherOutside/Blue fire in the north! I have discovered your secret name!
11486/HuncherOutside/I have buried it deep in the earth, and upon it built a house!
11487/HuncherOutside/You must obey this house!
11488/HuncherOutside/Now, blow west!
11489/HuncherOutside/Ok, that's done.
11490/HuncherOutside/Down you go!
11491/HuncherOutside/Stay off my porch!
11492/HuncherOutside/Accept it! You're freezing in the brambles tonight!
11493/HuncherOutside/Get away!
11494/Adina/There was something in that house. If I was just quick enough...
11495/Adina/Need something special for this.
11496/Adina/Oh god, I have to get back into that house.
11497/Adina/This is the worst Longest Night ever.
11498/Snowproblem/...
11499/HuncherInside/When you're out there tonight, freezing,
11500/HuncherInside/will you look for my ring?
11501/HuncherInside/Once something's down in the brambles I can never see it.
11502/HuncherKid/I found your ring last week.
11503/HuncherInside/Oh! So you did.
11504/HuncherInside/It's my second most prized possession.
11505/HuncherInside/I keep the most prized in a shrine, so precious is it to me.
11506/HuncherInside/And so painful. We have to keep the precious and painful close.
11507/Adina/I feel like we keep getting off-track here.
11508/HuncherInside/*sniff sniff*
11509/HuncherInside/I can smell the Forest God's blessing on you.
11510/HuncherInside/If you knew anything you'd wash until it came off with your skin.
11511/HuncherInside/When you leave, you're going down into the brambles like all the others.
11512/HuncherInside/When I have to go outside to fix the weather
11513/HuncherInside/because the weathervane got knocked around, AGAIN...
11514/HuncherKid/It's a really stupid system you have going there.
11515/HuncherInside/...when I get out to do that
11516/HuncherInside/I'll look out on the hollow, and nothing will be stirring.
11517/HuncherInside/And that will be what happened to you.
11518/Adina/Why don't you just kill me now, then?
11519/HuncherInside/Because of that smell.
11520/HuncherInside/I think you know the answer. You just showed up.
11521/HuncherInside/Ugh, we all just show up.
11522/HuncherInside/Staying is the problem.
11523/HuncherInside/But you won't have to worry about that.
11524/HuncherInside/Will you?
11525/Not Stated/Is that an extremely vague threat?
11526/Not Stated/Actually, I need to get to the Frozen Lake.
11527/HuncherKid/Her? Vague threats?
11528/HuncherInside/Oh, I'll get specific with you, kid.
11529/HuncherInside/I'm going to bury your pieces in a lonely hollow.
11530/HuncherInside/Not even bury them! I didn't bury the last one.
11531/HuncherInside/And SHE did chores!
11532/HuncherInside/Your family will never find you.
11533/HuncherKid/Oh no. Not that.
11534/Not Stated/Is this your normal dynamic?
11535/Not Stated/*AHEM.* I need to get to the Frozen Lake.
11536/HuncherInside/This is the dynamic of everything.
11537/HuncherInside/No different for her.
11538/HuncherInside/They didn't even give you a name back at the sawmill, did they, kid?
11539/HuncherInside/Just kid?
11540/HuncherKid/Excuse me, the full name was Sawmill Kid.
11541/HuncherInside/Well, now you're just kid.
11542/Adina/They didn't name you?
11543/HuncherKid/...
11544/HuncherInside/You never realize how little and how much you need a name
11545/HuncherInside/until they refuse you yours.
11546/Adina/Huh.
11547/Adina/I'm sorry to keep steering us back to this,
11548/Adina/but I must reach the Frozen Lake.
11549/HuncherInside/What are you, anyway?
11550/Adina/I'm an astronomer. Former apprentice.
11551/Adinda/First in my observatory, actually.
11552/HuncherInside/Oh honey, all of those stars in your head.
11553/HuncherInside/They will go out like candles tonight.
11554/Adina/What are you?
11555/HuncherInside/The Forest God isn't really a god.
11556/HuncherInside/I am twice their size.
11557/HuncherInside/I am twice as real.
11558/HuncherInside/Honestly, whoever you are, even you're twice as real as they are.
11559/Adina/Adina. Adina Astra.
11560/HuncherInside/A ridiculous name. You named yourself. I can tell.
11561/HuncherInside/...just the last part.
11562/HuncherInside/Now, what would make a little girl change her last name?
11563/Adina/Nothing you'd understand.
11564/HuncherInside/You don't know a thing about it. I came from somewhere.
11565/HuncherInside/As did the woman before me.
11566/HuncherInside/And we found the cabin, and I fed the oven.
11567/HuncherInside/And we survived, and then I survived.
11568/HuncherInside/And the quarrel with the Forest God went on for centuries.
11569/HuncherInside/Until it ended. Quite recently.
11570/HuncherKid/Well-
11571/HuncherInside/SHUT IT, KID.
11572/HuncherInside/I swear if I wasn't physically present in here she'd talk about anything.
11573/Adina/Are you a witch?
11574/HuncherInside/What is a witch? You mean the women in the woods?
11575/HuncherInside/A man in the woods is a hermit or a woodsman or a huntsman.
11576/HuncherInside/They didn't have a name for women who weren't where they should be.
11577/HuncherInside/So they stole a name they feared and hated
11578/HuncherInside/and pressed it onto us.
11579/HuncherKid/Onto you. The word they use for girls like me is "kidnapped".
11580/HuncherInsdie/*sigh*
11581/HuncherInside/This one. Every day, I swear.
11582/HuncherInside/Won't do chores.
11583/HuncherInside/Back-sass. Sass-mouth.
11584/Adina/Why not send her back where she came from?
11585/HuncherInside/That is the one question to which I have no answer.
11586/HuncherInside/We're done talking.
11587/HuncherInside/I'm sorry, Adina Astra.
11588/HuncherInside/I know you wanted to live
11589/HuncherInside/But I've taken that future from you
11590/HuncherInside/And it's mine now.
11591/HuncherInside/And you can't take it back.
11592/Snowproblem/What? No. No.
11593/Snowproblem/*cough* *cough* *cough*
11594/Snowproblem/NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
11595/HuncherOutside/What is this?
11596/HuncherOutside/Oh. Oh god. No.
11597/HuncherOutside/Girl, what have you done?
11598/HuncherSisterGhost/You... you watched it happen!
11599/HuncherSisterGhost/[wave][size=.75]YOU WAAAAAAAAAAAAAATCHED!
11600/HuncherOutside/It wasn't me! It was this place!
11601/HuncherSisterGhost/It was the oven. It was what you became.
11602/HuncherOutside/I didn't get to choose what happened to me!
11603/HuncherSisterGhost/I was so cold. I was so afraid.
11604/HuncherOutside/I had to survive!
11605/HuncherSisterGhost/and I did not.
11606/Adina/What is this? Who are you?
11607/HuncherOutside/Don't you dare speak, you waste of a girl.
11608/HuncherSisterGhost/I was her twin! We fled into the woods, identical in all things
11609/HuncherSisterGhost/except one.
11610/HuncherSisterGhost/When she pulled my body from the water
11611/HuncherSisterGhost/the only part of me she kept
11612/HuncherSisterGhost/was the tattoo.
11613/HuncherOutside/I've kept it close to me all down the centuries.
11614/HuncherSisterGhost/I believed in some idea of you...
11615/HuncherSisterGhost/that is as long dead as i am now.
11616/HuncherSisterGhost/but you survived.
11617/HuncherOutside/I... I...
11618/Adina/Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for this.
11619/HuncherOutside/Get out.
11620/Adina/I'm sorry!!! I never meant to-
11621/HuncherOutside/[shake=.05]GET OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUT!
11622/Mae/...
11623/Granddad/Yes, Mae?
11624/Mae/What is this story about?
11625/Granddad/What do you want it to be about?
11626/Mae/If I get to choose what it's about, it's not about anything.
11627/Granddad/Huh. That's quite a statement.
11628/Mae/I'm really smart.
11629/Granddad/Well you came up with that plan to rob banks
11630/Granddad/so clearly you're onto something.
11631/Mae/I want to know what this is about.
11632/Granddad/I think you have to figure that out on your own.
11633/Mae/...
11634/Mae/I don't like that.
11635/Adina/I can get you out of here.
11636/HuncherKid/You can't even get yourself out of here.
11637/HuncherKid/I can barely get out of the attic
11638/HuncherKid/and away from that extremely creepy shrine.
11639/Adina/It's not safe for you here.
11640/HuncherKid/Did you know, I made that poison and she never even thanked me?
11641/HuncherKid/She'll take all the credit for it!
11642/Adina/what?
11643/HuncherKid/I know, right?
11644/HuncherKid/Murdering a god isn't something you want to let someone else take credit for.
11645/Adina/Oh my god.
11646/Adina/I thought you were...
11647/HuncherKid/I'm going to survive.
11648/HuncherKid/Nobody who would know I'm gone is anyone I'd want to find me.
11649/Adina/I need to go.
11650/HuncherKid/Get away if you can.
11651/Adina/The huncher is about!
11652/Adina/Hm.
11653/Adina/Should probably check that house first.
11654/Adina/Ok, time to build.
11655/Adina/Some of that weird snow is way up in the trees.
11656/Adina/Need a good strong wind.
11657/Adina/Ha ha ha. Just need to control the wind is all. Simple.
11658/Adina/Ugh.
11659/Adina/I am not going to die here tonight.
11660/Adina/I'm just not.
11661/Adina/I need to see what's in this hollow.
11662/Adina/I need to get into that house.
11663/Adina/Ok, let's go.
11664/Adina/I'm so cold. So cold.
11665/Adina/No.
11666/Adina/I'm an Astronomer.
11667/Adina/Those are my skies, damn it.
11668/Adina/I'm gonna survive this.
11669/Adina/She seems distracted by that weather thing.
11670/Adina/Maybe... hmm...
11671/Adina/Hello?
11672/CoffinWolf/Hello! Interested in a coffin?
11673/Adina/Uh.
11674/Not Stated/In the short term?
11675/Not Stated/In the long run?
11676/CoffinWolf/You never know!
11677/CoffinWolf/These are hard times
11678/CoffinWolf/and these woods will take your life.
11679/Adina/You are the second person who lives here to tell me I'm going to die here.
11680/Adina/You're still alive.
11681/CoffinWolf/You can get out pretty easily, heading west.
11682/CoffinWolf/The problem is getting through, to the east.
11683/CoffinWolf/These are hard times. The days are short and the nights are long.
11684/CoffinWolf/And the winter lasts forever.
11685/Adina/Meaning?
11686/CoffinWolf/Meaning you have a bright future in being a lump in a snowbank
11687/Coffinwolf/if you keep heading east.
11688/CoffinWolf/So head west. West is home.
11689/Adina/Well, east is where I'm going, so...
11690/CoffinWolf/The trees here move. They'll confuse your path.
11691/CoffinWolf/They bend to the powers of the God of This Forest
11692/Coffinwolf/and [speed=.5][shake=.02]The Huncher[/all] herself.
11693/CoffinWolf/And you'll never obtain their permission to pass.
11694/Adina/So this is why you're trying to sell me a coffin?
11695/CoffinWolf/I provide a service- if you pay me now, I will collect your remains and bring them back to your relations.
11696/Adina/You charge in advance for this?
11697/CoffinWolf/I can't really charge any other time.
11698/Adina/Oh. Right.
11699/Adina/Well, I don't have any money.
11700/CoffinWolf/Eh-eh. No coffin for you then.
11701/CoffinWolf/And your ghost will be quite unhappy.
11702/Adina/Whatever.
11703/Adina/What'd you say about my ghost?
11704/CoffinWolf/Those that die here, stay here. Their ghosts lie frozen until disturbed.
11705/Adina/Oh.
11706/CoffinWolf/All that's left of them are lumps in the snow and the things they brought with them
11707/CoffinWolf/gathering frost.
11708/CoffinWolf/Oh what those ghosts could tell us in these hard times.
11709/Adina/Can I have a drink of something?
11710/CoffinWolf/No.
11711/CoffinWolf/You let the cold in every time you open the door, you know.
11712/Mae/What did you say?
11713/Granddad/Adina could see something up in the branches. Something that didn't belong.
11714/Mae/She should climb up and get it and stop standing there like a lump.
11715/Granddad/A lump?
11716/Mae/Yeah she's lumping around and she should climb a tree.
11717/Granddad/Adina wasn't much of a climber, so she had to improvise...
11718/Mae/Was she LOST?
11719/Granddad/She sure was! No matter how far she walked, she was never far from the forest's edge.
11720/Mae/THAT'S WEIRD!
11721/Granddad/These were no normal woods. These were magic woods.
11722/Mae/That's dumb.
11723/Granddad/These were the dangerous kind of magic woods.
11724/Mae/Oh ok that sounds cool.
11725/Mae/How did she get through???
11726/Granddad/Well, maybe she needed some directions.
11727/Mae/Aw but who from? She all alone.
11728/Granddad/When you don't have any friends, you have to make them.
11729/Granddad/That snow from the tree?
11730/Granddad/It was special snow.
11731/Mae/How do you figure?
11732/Granddad/Well, if you knew just where to build it,
11733/Granddad/you could make one hell of a snowman from that snow.
11734/Mae/That's it? That's not special.
11735/Granddad/You're a tough audience, kid.
11736/Mae/JUST TELL A BETTER STORY!
11737/Granddad/I could read you Charity Bearity Learns To Shareity again.
11738/Mae/No, she is the woooooooorst!
11739/Granddad/Ok, then, listen...
11740/Snowman0/AAAAAAAAAAGH!
11741/Adina/OH MY GOD!
11742/Snowman0/WHAT AM I?!?!?!
11743/Adina/WHAT'S HAPPENING???
11744/Snowman0/WHAT AM I?!?!?!?!
11745/Adina/HELP!!!
11746/Adina/Are you ok?
11747/Snowman0/what am i
11748/Adina/You're a snowman?
11749/Snowman0/i'm just water and garbage!
11750/Adina/How are you talking?
11751/Snowman0/i don't know what anything
11752/Adina/You wouldn't happen to know how to find the Forest God, would you?
11753/Snowman0/there's nothing about me that isn't forest and sky
11754/Adina/That's like a poem.
11755/Snowman0/WHAT AM I
11756/Adina/You're like a poem!
11757/Snowman0/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
11758/Adina/So you're what, a ghost?
11759/Snowman0/no ghost
11760/Adina/Wait, you are no ghost or you have no ghost?
11761/Snowman0/what am i
11762/Adina/How's it going?
11763/Snowman0/what is going
11764/Adina/Ok then.
11765/Mae/This snowman is no help!
11766/Granddad/Well, if at first you don't succeed...
11767/Mae/Kill it! And make a better one!
11768/Granddad/Well ok, you got that partly right.
11769/Mae/Which part?
11770/Granddad/Listen up and I'll tell you...
11771/CoffinWolf/Please leave. You've misused the oven.
11772/CoffinWolf/Hello, can I interest you in a- WHAT IS THAT?
11773/Not Stated/It's an arm. Goodbye now!
11774/Not Stated/I need to borrow your stove...
11775/CoffinWolf/Wait, what are you doing?
11776/Adina/Putting this skeleton arm in your stove.
11777/CoffinWolf/Um, no? No you're not!
11778/Adina/Ssssh.
11779/Adina/It is done.
11780/CoffinWolf/That is [shake=.1]messed up.
11781/Adina/You're telling me.
11782/CoffinWolf/Please leave now.
11783/Adina/Hello!
11784/King/Ho there traveler!
11785/Advisor/Hello!
11786/Knight/Hrmphm
11787/King/What is your business here tonight?
11788/Not Stated/I'm going to the Frozen Lake
11789/Not Stated/Not much, you?
11790/Adina/So is this your land?
11791/King/...
11792/Advisor/...
11793/Knight/...mrphrb phhrhvph...
11794/Adina/I was just saying, because you're a king and all.
11795/King/I may be a king.
11796/Advisor/You may be!
11797/King/But there are kings and there are gods.
11798/Advisor/Yes yes.
11799/Adina/Oh.
11800/King/And as king I granted these lands to Baroness Lalopsey.
11801/Advisor/And she sure did die!
11802/King/Sure did!
11803/Advisor/Lalopsey Manor's gone all weird now!
11804/King/Sure has!
11805/Advisor/Last spring travelers saw this pale thing come out of the bog there and-
11806/King/Well, let's head out! Miles to go, men. Miles to go.
11807/Adina/Oh ok. That's a good omen I'm sure.
11808/Adina/...
11809/Adina/Crap almighty.
11810/Adina/Hey skeleton.
11811/Adina/Well, I need an arm.
11812/Adina/And that's an arm.
11813/Adina/If I'm lucky, this skeleton is a criminal.
11814/Adina/Was.
11815/Adina/...
11816/Adina/This used to be alive.
11817/Adina/Now I just need to find a fire to stick it in.
11818/Adina/OH GOD.
11819/Adina/It's cold.
11820/CoffinWolf/Goodbye!
11821/Adina/Hello?
11822/Snowacle/Hello.
11823/Adina/Are you ok?
11824/Snowacle/Well, just before now I was dead.
11825/Snowacle/And I'm still dead. So there's that.
11826/Adina/Oh. Sorry.
11827/Snowacle/Maybe this means I can leave these woods...
11828/Snowacle/and go wherever dead people go?
11829/Adina/Is that how that works?
11830/Snowacle/I think I was in some sort of a daze.
11831/Snowacle/And this woke me up.
11832/Adina/If you want to return the favor, I need some help.
11833/Snowacle/I can tell your fortune, I can contact the dead...
11834/Adina/I need to find the Forest God. I need to get through the woods.
11835/Snowacle/Oh, well the first part's easy enough.
11836/Snowacle/Find the shrine and say North's Canticle.
11837/Not Stated/What is that?
11838/Not Stated/I wasn't a churchgoer...
11839/ShrineMouse/Pilgrim!
11840/Adina/Hello, you!
11841/ShrineMouse/I'm Father Patience Forget-Not-God.
11842/Adina/WOW. That is a name.
11843/ShrineMouse/It was gifted me when I was ordained.
11844/Adina/What was your name before?
11845/ShrineMouse/Butchie Mudd.
11846/Adina/Ok, that's a change.
11847/ShrineMouse/Do you wish to say a prayer at this
11848/ShrineMouse/the shrine of Saint Orolony
11849/ShrineMouse/who, beloved of the Forest God,
11850/ShrineMouse/was shown the way to the chasm and the red bell
11851/ShrineMouse/and into his holy mountain?
11852/Adina/You said that all without taking a breath!
11853/Adina/Who are you?
11854/Adina/I mean, are you a ghost?
11855/Snowacle/I don't know?
11856/Adina/Who were you before?
11857/Snowacle/I was a fortune teller, and a medium.
11858/Adina/A real one?
11859/Snowacle/Real enough.
11860/Adina/See, I found this thing in a tree, and then I knew I had to build you here, somehow.
11861/Snowacle/In seances we would often hold an object of importance to the deceased.
11862/Adina/Did it work?
11863/Snowacle/Well enough.
11864/Snowacle/As for why here, well...
11865/Snowacle/Sometimes a grave is the best place to contact the dead.
11866/Adina/Oh god is this your grave?
11867/Snowacle/Not mine. It appears to be someone's final resting place.
11868/Adina/Who buries people way out here?
11869/Snowacle/The snow.
11870/Snowacle/Whoa, keep that away. I don't want to melt.
11871/Snowacle/Alright, you've got a frozen arm.
11872/Snowacle/From somewhere.
11873/Snowacle/Or someone.
11874/Snowacle/I'm not going to ask.
11875/Adina/Now I have to set this arm on fire.
11876/Snowacle/Thanks for the update.
11877/Snowacle/Good luck!
11878/Adina/Hey there... you ok?
11879/Adina/I didn't have a chance to ask about you
11880/Adina/and how you got here.
11881/Snowacle/I think I'm gone...
11882/Snowacle/I can hardly hear you...
11883/Adina/Oh.
11884/Snowacle/Yes.
11885/Adina/Thank you so much.
11886/Adina/You saved my life, fortune-teller.
11887/Snowacle/I was a real one, you know.
11888/Snowacle/it was real to me
11889/Snowacle/even if
11890/Snowacle/my sister, in the walls
11891/Snowacle/...
11892/Adina/Hello?
11893/Adina/Goodbye.
11894/Adina/Hm. I think I need something special for this one.
11895/Adina/Otherwise I'm just bringing more screaming forest ice-babies into the world.
11896/Adina/And that's no good.
11897/Adina/Hey Sticky!
11898/Snowman0/what is sticky
11899/Adina/I named you Sticky.
11900/Adina/Because of-
11901/Snowman0/stick-y
11902/Adina/-the sticks.
11903/Snowman0/STICK-y.
11904/Adina/yep.
11905/Snowman0/why is stick-y
11906/Snowman0/...
11907/Adina/Are you gone already, Sticky?
11908/Snowman0/...
11909/Adina/I'm sorry, Sticky.
11910/Snowacle/"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
11911/Snowacle/"All things die, Be at peace!"
11912/Snowacle/"Cease all care, They are coming."
11913/Snowacle/"God of The forest, carry us."
11914/Adina/Where did you learn that?
11915/Snowacle/We only said it in church twice a week
11916/Snowacle/and also five times a day.
11917/Snowacle/Didn't you?
11918/Adina/I'm not from around here.
11919/Snowacle/Once I wasn't either.
11920/Snowacle/Listen, I still have some remnant of my sensitivities.
11921/Adina/What?
11922/Snowacle/If you're lost, I can try to point you in the right direction.
11923/Adina/Thanks!
11924/Snowacle/Oh you little heathen!
11925/Snowacle/A girl after my own heart. Eh heh heh.
11926/Adina/Do you know it?
11927/Snowacle/"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
11928/Snowacle/"All things die, Be at peace!"
11929/Snowacle/"Cease all care, They are coming."
11930/Snowacle/"God of The forest, carry us."
11931/Adina/And people say that?
11932/Snowacle/Several times a day in this country.
11933/Adina/Hm.
11934/Snowacle/Listen, I still have some remnant of my sensitivities.
11935/Adina/What?
11936/Snowacle/If you're lost, I can try to point you in the right direction.
11937/Adina/Thanks!
11938/King/We're doing much!
11939/Advisor/Come with us, we can do much!
11940/Knight/...mrph phr phrmpt...
11941/King/Right you are, Stevenson! She can't come with us!
11942/Advisor/You're right! Ha ha ha ha!
11943/Adina/Big plans, then?
11944/King/We have our agenda for an audience with the Forest God!
11945/Advisor/We have the [speed=.75][color=aaaaaa]severed arm of a criminal
11946/Not Stated/What did you say you were going to set on fire?
11947/Not Stated/Well, that sounds- WAIT, an arm?!
11948/King/Well, that's a coincidence! So are we!
11949/Advisor/Blessed meeting!
11950/Adina/Do you know the way through the woods?
11951/King/We surely do! We are bound for an audience with the Forest God!
11952/Advisor/And after that we have an arm, [speed=.75][color=aaaaaa]and fire to light it!
11953/Not Stated/What did you say you were going to set on fire?
11954/Not Stated/Are you going to find The Hunch... wait, an arm? What?
11955/King/The [speed=.75][color=aaaaaa]arm of a dead criminal!
11956/Advisor/Donated, of course.
11957/Knight/...hrmmphhr...
11958/King/Ha ha ha!
11959/Advisor/Oh Stevenson.
11960/Adina/And you're going to [speed=.75][color=aaaaaa]set it on fire?
11961/King/Yes!
11962/Advisor/And it will light the way to the Huncher's Hollow!
11963/Adina/Ugh this forest.
11964/Adina/Well, best of luck!
11965/King/Best of luck to everyone!
11966/Advisor/Even you! We have enough luck to go around
11967/CoffinWolf/Back to buy a coffin?
11968/Adina/No, just getting warm.
11969/CoffinWolf/I'm going to start charging for that.
11970/Adina/If I don't have any money for a coffin
11971/Adina/why would I have money standing by your stove?
11972/CoffinWolf/I dunno, let's ask the free market.
11973/Coffinwolf/There goes all of my heat again, right out the door.
11974/Adina/Sorry.
11975/ShrineMouse/Go in the peace of the God of the Forest, my child.
11976/ShrineMouse/You may recite when ready.
11977/Not Stated/Gracious Tree Lord, Leafy And Barked
11978/Not Stated/Exalted Bear Enthroned Above
11979/Not Stated/Enchanted Deer Monster, Hoofy In The Night
11980/Adina/Um... hello?
11981/TreeCat/'Evening.
11982/Adina/Hey, didn't I see you before?
11983/TreeCat/Hm?
11984/Adina/Outside the forest?
11985/TreeCat/No.
11986/Adina/I think I did. But you didn't have a hat.
11987/TreeCat/Couldn't be me. I do have a hat.
11988/Adina/Hm.
11989/Adina/Wasn't there a mouse here a minute ago?
11990/TreeCat/Yep.
11991/Adina/Did you eat it?
11992/TreeCat/No. He just gave me his hat.
11993/Adina/Oh.
11994/Adina/Where is...
11995/Adina/OH MY GOD.
11996/Adina/YOU ATE FATHER PATIENCE FORGET-NOT-GOD?!
11997/TreeCat/No. He left.
11998/Adina/YOU'RE WEARING HIS LITTLE HAT!
11999/TreeCat/He gave me his hat.
12000/Adina/...
12001/TreeCat/I feel so official.
12002/Adina/I hate you.
12003/Treecat/You got a prayer for me, Pilgrim?
12004/Adina/Wait, why do you need to hear this?
12005/TreeCat/It's not for me. It's for the shrine.
12006/TreeCat/It's not for me or the mouse. It's for the shrine.
12007/Adina/Hm.
12008/TreeCat/Prrrrr.
12009/Not Stated/"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
12010/Not Stated/Listen, do we have to do this?
12011/ShrineMouse/My wandering child! Are you here to say a prayer?
12012/Not Stated/Why yes, I am!
12013/Not Stated/No, not right now
12014/ShrineMouse/D...
12015/ShrineMouse/Deer...
12016/ShrineMouse/MONSTER?!?!?!
12017/Adina/Ok I'll admit that one was a total guess.
12018/ShrineMouse/You clearly have not known our Forest God.
12019/Adina/Listen, I'm not from around here, and-
12020/ShrineMouse/GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
12021/ShrineMouse/BEAR?
12022/Adina/I figured the forest god was maybe a giant bear?
12023/ShrineMouse/The Forest God is no mere bear.
12024/ShrineMouse/The Forest God is no bear at all.
12025/Adina/Oh.
12026/ShrineMouse/GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
12027/ShrineMouse/The Forest God is no tree!!!!
12028/Adina/I thought that, you know, because of the forest...
12029/ShrineMouse/No tree can be a god!
12030/Adina/I'm not following this line of logic.
12031/Adina/So what *can* be a god?
12032/ShrineMouse/Not a tree, obviously!
12033/ShrineMouse/GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
12034/ShrineMouse/You may recite when ready.
12035/Not Stated/Wolf! Wolf! Thrice Wolf!
12036/Not Stated/Sweetest Baby Moose, Oh Gentle Moose
12037/Not Stated/Wooly Cat Of The North, Hear My Petition
12038/ShrineMouse/Wolf? Wolf? Wolf?
12039/Adina/Wrong?
12040/ShrineMouse/Have you ever prayed before?
12041/Adina/Kinda?
12042/ShrineMouse/GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
12043/ShrineMouse/I'm not sure where to even begin.
12044/Adina/Please don't judge my personal faith.
12045/ShrineMouse/GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
12046/ShrineMouse/THE FOREST GOD IS NO FILTHY CAT!
12047/Adina/Oh no?
12048/ShrineMouse/GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
12049/ShrineMouse/My child, have you learned yet how to pray?
12050/Not Stated/...no...
12051/Mae/So those snowthings are ghosts?
12052/Granddad/Well, they have ghosts in them.
12053/Mae/Are there ghosts?
12054/Granddad/What do you think?
12055/Mae/No, what do you think?
12056/Granddad/Well, I think sometimes people stay with you long after they're gone.
12057/Mae/Is grandma a ghost now?
12058/Granddad/Ha ha ha. On the best days, yes.
12059/Mae/I don't want you to ever be a ghost.
12060/Granddad/Oh Mae, I'll be around to see your own kids.
12061/Mae/No you won't.
12062/Granddad/Well Mae, that's not a very nice thing to say.
12063/Mae/No, I mean I don't ever want kids ever.
12064/Mae/I want two big wooly barn cats and an old hound dog.
12065/Mae/and we'll all howl at the moon!
12066/Granddad/Never change, Mae.
12067/TreeCat/Continue.
12068/Not Stated/"All things die, Be at peace!"
12069/Not Stated/Is the Forest God only God when I'm in the Forest?
12070/TreeCat/You need to see the Forest God.
12071/Adina/Yes.
12072/TreeCat/This is how you see the Forest God.
12073/TreeCat/Or try to, at least.
12074/Adina/Try to?
12075/TreeCat/That old thing doesn't see just anyone anymore.
12076/TreeCat/Those days are gone.
12077/Adina/So I just need to say the words?
12078/TreeCat/No one knows what you mean, they just know what you say.
12079/Adina/Fine, then.
12080/Adina/"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
12081/TreeCat/This forest stretches from the hills below
12082/TreeCat/over the mountains
12083/TreeCat/and up to where they have to build a bonfire
12084/TreeCat/to thaw the earth enough
12085/TreeCat/to bury the dead.
12086/Adina/Wow.
12087/TreeCat/God of this forest is god enough.
12088/Adina/Noted.
12089/Adina/ok... um...
12090/Adina/"All things die, Be at peace!"
12091/TreeCat/Continue.
12092/Not Stated/"Cease all care, They are coming."
12093/Not Stated/Why are you helping me?
12094/TreeCat/Continue.
12095/Not Stated/"God of The forest, carry us."
12096/Not Stated/Should I be feeling something?
12097/TreeCat/Who says I'm helping you?
12098/TreeCat/I'm just sitting here.
12099/TreeCat/With my hat.
12100/Adina/...
12101/TreeCat/Go on?
12102/Adina/"Cease all care, They are coming."
12103/TreeCat/Very nice.
12104/Treecat/Goodbye.
12105/TreeCat/Something?
12106/Adina/Like, is this gonna do something?
12107/TreeCat/You don't feel a great sense of awe and wonder
12108/TreeCat/and connection to something larger than yourself?
12109/Adina/No.
12110/TreeCat/Your loss.
12111/Adina/I feel that when I look at the stars.
12112/Adina/Back in the world, stars are kind of my job.
12113/TreeCat/We're still in the world. Still the same stars too.
12114/Adina/Ok, let's finish this.
12115/TreeCat/Let's.
12116/Adina/"God of The forest, carry us."
12117/Snowman0/why is stick-y
12118/King/Beautiful forest, don't you think?
12119/Adina/Not to harp on this, and thank you again for your help,
12120/Adina/but do you know whose body is under you?
12121/Snowacle/No idea. I don't think it matters.
12122/Snowacle/Just a connection to wherever.
12123/Adina/Were you... um... somewhere else until now?
12124/Snowacle/I don't know. I don't think so.
12125/Snowacle/You don't even seem real.
12126/Snowacle/This is like a waking dream.
12127/Adina/This is weird.
12128/Snowacle/Yes it is.
12129/Adina/Ok, so I can't just take you apart, but
12130/Adina/are you in pain?
12131/Adina/You just seem so sad, Sticky.
12132/Snowman0/i am nothing
12133/Adina/See, I don't know how to interpret that?
12134/Adina/Like, are you depressed or are you literally saying you are sticks and ice?
12135/Snowman0/i am sticks and ice
12136/Adina/...
12137/Adina/Yeah, I still got nothing. I'll be back, Sticky!
12138/Snowman0/stick-y... be back...
12139/Adina/That's the spirit, Sticky!
12140/Snowman0/stick-y-y-y-y
12141/Adina/You sure are!
12142/Adina/You're a fraud!
12143/CoffinWolf/Why hello! Nice of you to stop by!
12144/Adina/There are frozen dead people all over these woods!
12145/Adina/I've talked to half a dozen of them tonight alone!
12146/Adina/Either no one takes you up on this coffin business
12147/Adina/Or you never follow through!
12148/Adina/So which is it?!
12149/Adina/Huh?!
12150/CoffinWolf/You talked to ghosts?
12151/Adina/Yeah! A whole bunch!
12152/CoffinWolf/I think you got lost and cold and started talking to the snow.
12153/Adina/No! I've been all the way from the Forest God's mountain
12154/Adina/to [shake=.01][color=aaaaaa]The Huncher's Hollow[/all] for god's sake.
12155/CoffinWolf/And yet here you are, back at my cabin, not more than an hour after you last left.
12156/Adina/...
12157/CoffinWolf/Letting the heat out and the cold in.
12158/CoffinWolf/Busy night for you, eh?
12159/Adina/Oh, go to hell.
12160/CoffinWolf/Ha ha ha.
12161/CoffinWolf/Hell's warm at least.
12162/CoffinWolf/Goodnight.
12163/ShrineMouse/You want to pray or not?
12164/Not Stated/Why yes, I do!
12165/Not Stated/No, not right now
12166/Adina/"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
12167/Adina/"All things die, Be at peace!"
12168/Adina/"Cease all care, They are coming."
12169/Adina/"God of The forest, carry us."
12170/Adina/Kid?
12171/HuncherKidLW/She's gone.
12172/HuncherKidLW/She just left.
12173/Adina/Just now?
12174/HuncherKidLW/All I know is that sometime after she left
12175/HuncherKidLW/something happened.
12176/HuncherKidLW/She stopped being what she was.
12177/HuncherKidLW/I don't know if she died, or...
12178/HuncherKidLW/but something is happening to me.
12179/Adina/Can't you just go back home?
12180/HuncherKidLW/Child, I am home.
12181/Adina/Oh.
12182/HuncherKidLW/But I am going to visit where I came from.
12183/Adina/That's good!
12184/HuncherKidLW/No. No, you don't understand.
12185/HuncherKidLW/I used to hope no one who knew I was gone would come looking for me.
12186/HuncherKidLW/But now I'm going to go looking for them.
12187/HuncherKidLW/The townsfolk will weep when they see what I've done to them.
12188/HuncherKidLW/And as they go into the ground, I will dig them up
12189/HuncherKidLW/I will place them in the beds of those who loved them.
12190/HuncherKidLW/And people will look at that ruin of a town
12191/HuncherKidLW/and say it is haunted.
12192/Adina/Oh, Kid, listen to me-
12193/HuncherKidLW/Oh please, child.
12194/HuncherKidLW/Until an hour ago I was younger than you. But now I am far, far older.
12195/HuncherKidLW/You were kind to me, and I will give you this kindness in return:
12196/HuncherKidLW/We won't meet again.
12197/Adina/Hmm what's this?
12198/Adina/Looks like a good spot for a snowman...
12199/Snowacle/The trees here are weird.
12200/Snowavle/Who knows what they've been into?
12201/Snowacle/Look to the trees.
12202/Adina/You said something about the trees?
12203/Adina/Sometimes I don't see anything but snow up there.
12204/Snowacle/Weird snow.
12205/Adina/Weird snow?
12206/Snowacle/Weird. Snow.
12207/Adina/I'll check it out.
12208/Snowacle/I have seen your future.
12209/Snowacle/It lies hidden in the branches.
12210/Adina/Ok. That's helpful.
12211/Snowacle/Bless you my ch-
12212/Snowacle/Oh. You were being sarcastic.
12213/Snowacle/...
12214/Adina/...
12215/Coffinwolf/Hello. Might I interest you in a coffin?
12216/Adina/No, I'm pretty sure I'll make it through the forest alive.
12217/Coffinwolf/How nice!
12218/Coffinwolf/In that case, get out!
12219/Adina/Hey!
12220/Snowacle/Hey, you! Still alive, eh?
12221/Snowacle/I just saw all of the trees give a great shudder
12222/Snowacle/like they were falling into line
12223/Snowacle/and then you walked up.
12224/Adina/I think the way is open to the Frozen Lake!
12225/Adina/What do you think about that?
12226/Snowacle/I think you should wrap up any business you have
12227/Snowacle/and head east as quickly as possible!
12228/Adina/Hm. What business would I still have?
12229/Snowacle/I wouldn't pretend to know.
12230/Snowacle/Hello
12231/Adina/I'm looking for the Huncher?
12232/Snowacle/I never found her.
12233/Snowacle/and maybe that's a good thing.
12234/Snowacle/she is not the forest god. she does not grant passage.
12235/Snowacle/she is something altogether more... nihilist? Is that the word?
12236/Adina/Huh.
12237/Snowacle/She's an impulse playing itself out.
12238/Snowacle/She isn't the first, and she won't be the last.
12239/Adina/What?
12240/Snowacle/Oh I don't know, child. I'm just talking.
12241/Snowacle/You'll never find her hollow without something to help you
12242/Snowacle/and I never found out what it was.
12243/Adina/thanks anyway.
12244/Snowacle/be careful. you're getting into something here.
12245/Mae/This is a great story now.
12246/Granddad/Oh, you like the spooky stuff, huh?
12247/Mae/You know I do. I hate the other stuff.
12248/Granddad/Well, the other stuff is important too. Hang in there.
12249/Mae/OK I GUESS
12250/Adina/I'm a bit nervous about the frozen lake.
12251/Snowacle/Do you know the story?
12252/Adina/Not really.
12253/Snowacle/Of how the lake was so deep
12254/Snowacle/it went down to the grave
12255/Snowacle/and the dead came to the surface
12256/Snowacle/and spoke with the living?
12257/Snowacle/Of how it was so black
12258/Snowacle/that it ate the moon's reflection?
12259/Snowacle/And how the moon, being jealous,
12260/Snowacle/convinced the sun to turn its back on the lake
12261/Snowacle/so it would be forever frozen?
12262/Snowacle/That is why the dead may be found beneath the ice.
12263/Snowacle/For they can no longer leave those waters.
12264/Adina/Did any of that happen?
12265/Snowacle/You're the one going there.
12266/Snowacle/You tell me.
12267/Snowacle/So you're looking for a severed arm...
12268/Adina/...yes.
12269/Snowacle/And then you're going to have to light it on fire?
12270/Adina/...yes.
12271/Snowacle/I'm kind of glad that I'm completely unable to help you with that.
12272/Adina/I'm going to go search for this arm now.
12273/Snowacle/...
12274/Snowacle/You're just stalling for time aren't you.
12275/Adina/*sigh*
12276/Snowacle/That arm ain't gonna sever itself!
12277/Adina/Alright, alright!
12278/Mae/Where is this place?
12279/Granddad/Back where your great-great-grandparents came from, before they came to this country.
12280/Granddad/But long before they were born and longer still before that.
12281/Not Stated/Do they have Longest Night there?
12282/Not Stated/They had Longest Night then?!
12283/Granddad/They do indeed!
12284/Mae/Do they give presents?
12285/Granddad/Those who can!
12286/Mae/They should all can.
12287/Granddad/What do... yeah ok. Anyway.
12288/Granddad/There's always been a Longest Night.
12289/Granddad/Even back before they came up with a name for it.
12290/Mae/What did they call it back then?
12291/Granddad/Longest Night.
12292/Mae/Oh.
12293/Adina/Cat! Hey cat!
12294/Adina/Do you live in this forest?
12295/TreeCat/Near enough.
12296/Adina/Can I ask you a question?
12297/TreeCat/You're going to die in there tonight.
12298/Adina/Wow. That is unhelpful.
12299/TreeCat/Is it?
12300/Not Stated/Where are you going tonight?
12301/Not Stated/Go away, cat!
12302/TreeCat/I'm visiting my relations, but first I'll go to church.
12303/Adina/That sounds like your standard Longest Night.
12304/TreeCat/Before church, I'll hunt up a vole.
12305/TreeCat/And eat it.
12306/TreeCat/And before that, I'll watch you walk into the woods
12307/TreeCat/To die.
12308/TreeCat/And before that, we'll say goodbye.
12309/Adina/Are you so sure?
12310/TreeCat/Prrrrr.
12311/Adina/Well, goodbye!
12312/TreeCat/HA HA HA HA.
12313/Adina/What are you-
12314/Adina/Oh I see.
12315/TreeCat/Goodbye.
12316/TreeCat/I'm on my way down the hills tonight, but I'll be back.
12317/TreeCat/I collect shiny things
12318/TreeCat/from the cold pockets
12319/TreeCat/of fools like you.
12320/Adina/Stop bothering me!
12321/TreeCat/I think it's you who bothered me?
12322/Adina/Get going then!
12323/TreeCat/There's always a moment to watch a fool make her last mistake.
12324/Adina/Oh very nice. That's helpful.
12325/Adina/...asscat...
12326/TreeCat/Prrrr.
12327/Adina/Well, a good Longest Night to you!
12328/TreeCat/I'll be going through your pockets by morning!
12329/Adina/Ok thanks!
12330/TreeCat/Goodbye!
12331/TreeCat/Prrrr.
12332/Adina/Hello again!
12333/King/Ah, we meet again!
12334/Advisor/I hope you are faring well!
12335/King/We were just leaving!
12336/Adina/Why?
12337/Advisor/Because a kingdom needs a king!
12338/King/And this king needs his trusted advisor!
12339/Adina/What happened to your sword guy?
12340/King/STEVENSON!
12341/Advisor/HE HAD A NAME, YOU KNOW.
12342/Adina/Sorry! What happened to him? Did you see the forest god?
12343/Advisor/STEEEEVEEEEENSOOOOON!
12344/King/We're going home now. I command it and I'm king.
12345/Advisor/Yes. Home now.
12346/King/I'm going to call a late-night feast!
12347/Advisor/It'll be a new tradition, sire!
12348/King/This will be the best Longest Night ever!
12349/Advisor/Too true!
12350/Adina/Well, happy Longest Night-
12351/King/The *BEST* Longest Night!
12352/Adina/Yes, that!
12353/King/Be safe!
12354/King/Let's sing a Longest Night carol!
12355/Advisor/Yes, that will raise our spirits!
12356/SnowfieldNPC/Hi, I'm a potential last-minute inclusion that would be a short conversation about how the Forest God is actually pretty dangerous! Also, the stars!
12357/Adina/Wow, that'd be cool!
12358/SnowfieldNPC/Yep, probably just single sprite sequence or something with some dialogue.
12359/Adina/Well, we'll see if we have time!
12360/SnowfieldNPC/Fingers crossed!
12361/Adina/I found his... helmet.
12362/Advisor/Where was it?
12363/Adina/It was back on the Forest God's mountain, you could just-
12364/King/NNNNNOPE!
12365/Advisor/Not going back there!
12366/Adina/Did he attack the Forest God?
12367/King/He would never do that! I would never order that!
12368/Advisor/Stevenson was a dear, dear man, and-
12369/King/Steady, old friend.
12370/Advisor/I shall be steady, sire.
12371/Adina/What happened?
12372/King/Nothing.
12373/Advisor/Nothing happened.
12374/King/I'm king and I say we go home now.
12375/Advisor/Excellent idea, sire.
12376/King/Safe journeys, whatever your name is!
12377/Adina/Adina.
12378/Advisor/Safe journeys, whoever you are!
12379/Adina/Adina.
12380/King/Goodbye.
12381/King/La la la la!
12382/Advisor/Bum bum bum da bum bum bum!
12383/Mae/Where does this happen?
12384/Granddad/Back where my grandparents came from, but long before they lived.
12385/Mae/Did they have longest night back then?
12386/Granddad/They did!
12387/Mae/What did they call it?
12388/Granddad/Longest night.
12389/Mae/Oh.
12390/Adina/Far from home here, alright.
12391/Adina/Could just go back...
12392/Adina/No.
12393/Adina/It's been a year, and you made a promise.
12394/Adina/Get ahold of yourself.
12395/Adina/You're not gonna die in there tonight.
12396/Adina/You're gonna see her again.
12397/Adina/and come back with a star.
12398/Adina/I think the fog is clearing!
12399/Adina/Wow this fog is too thick.
12400/Adina/Weird fog.
12401/Adina/How do you get rid of weird fog?
12402/Adina/Go away, fog!
12403/Adina/Ugh. How do I get rid of you?
12404/Mae/I'm gonna rob the bank!
12405/Granddad/Ha ha ha. You want to spend longest night in jail?
12406/Mae/Gonna rob 'em to death!
12407/Mae/They'll never catch me!
12408/Granddad/There'll be time enough when you're older for felonies and jail.
12409/Mae/What's a felony?
12410/Granddad/A bad thing they put you in jail for.
12411/Mae/Not if they don't catch me!
12412/Granddad/Ok, how about a story before bedtime?
12413/Mae/A Longest Night story!
12414/Granddad/Sure!
12415/Mae/But not a dumb one like Charity Bearity.
12416/Granddad/How about a ghost story?
12417/Mae/Oooooooh. Yeah.
12418/Granddad/Alright then-
12419/Mae/I hope lots of people die in it.
12420/Granddad/Quiet, kid. I'm starting over here.
12421/Granddad/Long ago, in the hills...
12422/Mae/Why aren't I cold?
12423/Gregg/Fire. We have a fire.
12424/Angus/We have reached that level as a civilization.
12425/Mae/Oh.
12426/Mae/I'm booooooored. Feels like we've been here forever.
12427/Bea/Oh! We should do the Longest Night constellation thing!
12428/Mae/Wow. Really?
12429/Gregg/I haven't done that since I was like 6.
12430/Mae/No one has done that since they were like 6.
12431/Bea/Well I don't remember being 6.
12432/Mae/Really?
12433/Gregg/Really?
12434/Bea/Yeah I don't remember much before like 8 and a half.
12435/Angus/That's very specific.
12436/Gregg/Bea is a synthetic lifeform created at age 8.5.
12437/Mae/This makes so much sense.
12438/Mae/**Beep boop, Bea.**
12439/Gregg/**ONE ONE ZERO ONE ONE ok whatever i'm done
12440/Bea/Can we just do this thing?
12441/Gregg/None of us knows enough about the constellations to even do it, BEA.
12442/Mae/Yeah, BEA.
12443/Angus/I do.
12444/Gregg/Since when?
12445/Angus/Since always.
12446/Angus/Now listen up dummies, we're going to school.
12447/Bea/Space school!
12448/Bea/I can't see anything.
12449/Angus/We're pattern-finders. Find some patterns!
12450/Angus/Well, that's all 13 of them.
12451/Bea/Yay! Thanks Angus!
12452/Mae/That was pretty great!
12453/Gregg/You're a big 'ol nerd, Cap'n.
12454/Angus/Yes.
12455/Angus/Yes I am.
12456/Gregg/You should be a professor.
12457/Angus/I like to think I fill that role at the video store.
12458/Bea/Well, I should probably get home.
12459/Mae/Wait.
12460/Mae/I just realized that I haven't hung out with you in years, Bea.
12461/Bea/What?
12462/Not Stated/Yeah, not since like 7th grade?
12463/Not Stated/We had a huge fight when we were 12!
12464/Bea/I remember. I was there. You were a massive jerk.
12465/Mae/But why am I at a Longest Night bonfire with you?
12466/Bea/Because you just missed me so much.
12467/Bea/I remember it more like you stopped sitting with me at lunch
12468/Bea/or returning my phone calls
12469/Bea/or responding to messages.
12470/Bea/Always with Gregg, too cool for me.
12471/Gregg/Sorry, Bea. Didn't mean to be a friendship wrecker.
12472/Bea/It's cool, Gregg, it was ages ago.
12473/Mae/Wait. Are we actually in space?
12474/Angus/...
12475/Mae/But I'm warm. And breathing?
12476/Mae/What am I sitting on?
12477/Angus/Tyrannosaurus pattern.
12478/Mae/What?
12479/Mae/Oh god... I haven't seen Gregg or Angus for a year and a half.
12480/Gregg/Regret and emptiness!
12481/Mae/I didn't go home for Longest Night.
12482/Bea/Laundry day!
12483/Gregg/Apple juice taste from when you threw up earlier.
12484/Bea/You have to call home.
12485/Gregg/You don't want to call home.
12486/Angus/It's too late to take the bus.
12487/Bea/What made you think of me today?
12488/Gregg/You don't want to take the bus. This is your new life.
12489/Bea/Is it still new after a year and a half?
12490/Angus/Underwear adjust!
12491/Gregg/Next year will be new again.
12492/Bea/Next you will be new again.
12493/Angus/Leg stretch!
12494/Mae/Oh COME ON, this is getting stupid. Am I seriously
12495/Mae/Well, home's not gonna call itself...
12496/Angus/Harmonium, the head of the singing orders of angels.
12497/Bea/Ugh. This one.
12498/Bea/My mom always said I looked like this one.
12499/Mae/I can see it!
12500/Bea/I sure can't.
12501/Mae/Leading so many cranky angels
12502/Bea/...
12503/Mae/grouching hard
12504/Bea/...
12505/Mae/across the sky.
12506/Bea/ok.
12507/Angus/Mooooooving on...
12508/Angus/Marmanodes, the little king.
12509/Angus/He was... um... a king who was little?
12510/Angus/I don't know anything about this one.
12511/Bea/Apparently a little king was big news back then.
12512/Bea/I don't think he was even supposed to be all that small.
12513/Angus/"Stop the presses!"
12514/Bea/"So there's this king, right?"
12515/Bea/"But get this- he's slightly smaller than you'd expect."
12516/Angus/"He wears small shoes! Let's immortalize him in the night sky!"
12517/Mae/I'm kinda short!
12518/Gregg/Mae Borowski: Constellation.
12519/Bea/Naw.
12520/Bea/Everyone who picked the constellations is dead now.
12521/Angus/Tollmetron.
12522/Angus/It rings at the end of the world
12523/Angus/and Mundy shakes everything off her back
12524/Angus/and I think it all catches fire too.
12525/Gregg/It all made sense back then.
12526/Mae/Back when people were like wicked dumb.
12527/Bea/Yeah I don't mean to sound like a jerk but people were super dumb back then.
12528/Angus/It's all relative.
12529/Mae/And full of dumb people.
12530/Angus/Beautiful, dumb people.
12531/Angus/Rubello, Pope sometime in the 1400s. Crazy times.
12532/Bea/Oh god I love this one.
12533/Angus/There were two rival popes
12534/Angus/and Rubello won by opening his mouth
12535/Angus/and consuming them with fire.
12536/Angus/and then he ate them.
12537/Mae/WHAT
12538/Bea/BWAAAAAAAAAH
12539/Gregg/I knew that one!
12540/Mae/That is amazing.
12541/Angus/I mean historically his extended family poisoned one
12542/Angus/and stabbed the other before throwing him into a canal
12543/Bea/But he did eat them.
12544/Angus/He did eat them, yes.
12545/Mae/That is the raddest thing I have ever heard.
12546/Bea/CHOMP CHOMP whoops I ate you. Now I'm the pope.
12547/Angus/The Broken Snake, the first thing that talked.
12548/Bea/This story has always made me so annoyed.
12549/Mae/I was totally the kid in sunday school who pitched a fit over this story.
12550/Bea/Oh my god I remember that!
12551/Bea/You got sent out to adult church to sit with your parents!
12552/Mae/No punch and cookies for me!
12553/Gregg/Wow I certainly missed out on all of that.
12554/Angus/Oh dude, you didn't even.
12555/Angus/Corvin, The Thief.
12556/Angus/Stole the diamond from the crown of Rubello, the fire-breathing pope.
12557/Angus/Got arrowed to death like 200 feet from the palace.
12558/Mae/So he didn't get to be a constellation for being a great thief, then.
12559/Bea/He did not.
12560/Gregg/Screw the man. Steal their diamonds.
12561/ALL/Screw the man.
12562/Bea/Ah yes, the revolutionary zeal of kids from the suburbs.
12563/Mae/Possum Springs isn't the suburbs!
12564/Angus/Yeah you need a city to have suburbs.
12565/Mae/We're in the dead center of nowhere.
12566/Mae/It's like a 40 minute drive if you want to buy shoes.
12567/Angus/Also I'm 21! I'm not a kid! I think you're younger than me!
12568/Gregg/I'm 21 too. We both have full time jobs.
12569/Angus/Well, as close to full time as they can get
12570/Angus/before they have to start giving us health insurance.
12571/Mae/I'll be 20 in like 4 months!
12572/Bea/Ok FINE. You're all very serious adults.
12573/Angus/Thank you.
12574/Gregg/Yes, thank you.
12575/Angus/Harmonium, the head of the singing orders of angels.
12576/Bea/Nice of them to throw us a bone.
12577/Bea/A really condescending, boring bone.
12578/Angus/Yeah, moving on...
12579/Angus/Lucio!
12580/Gregg/Aw yeah!
12581/Not Stated/Who?
12582/Not Stated/What?
12583/Angus/A Fish.
12584/Mae/...and?
12585/Angus/Just a fish. Pretty self explanatory.
12586/Bea/Huh.
12587/Angus/Fun fact: Fish is my sign.
12588/Not Stated/I think that means you're adaptable and smelly.
12589/Not Stated/I think that means you're a failure in all things.
12590/Angus/Invenerus, the inventor of music.
12591/Bea/Nice beak. Reminds me of Germ.
12592/Angus/Ha ha.
12593/Gregg/Germ isn't even musical. Like at all.
12594/Not Stated/Who?
12595/Not Stated/Germ?
12596/Angus/Um... Quinona. Executed by some king somewhere.
12597/Angus/Her head continued to speak against her murderers for years.
12598/Mae/That's pretty sweet.
12599/Bea/Ugh. You'd think, right?
12600/Bea/But in the story she's portrayed as annoying.
12601/Bea/like she was being a martyr
12602/Bea/about literally being martyred.
12603/Bea/They eventually put her head in a trunk and threw it in a river.
12604/Not Stated/Geez!
12605/Not Stated/What did she do?
12606/Angus/Ibon, the first singer.
12607/Bea/Ever see the opera based on this?
12608/Not Stated/No?
12609/Not Stated/Oh yeah!
12610/Angus/The Mice Writers, inventors of written language.
12611/Bea/Weren't there supposed to be thousands of them?
12612/Mae/Listen, there's only so much sky.
12613/Gregg/The Mice Writers are my sign.
12614/Not Stated/I think that means you're thousands of geniuses.
12615/Not Stated/I think that means you're screwed.
12616/Angus/Mundy, the world fish. Back then they thought whales were fish.
12617/Angus/And you know, that the world was on one.
12618/Mae/Mundy is my sign.
12619/Bea/Oh god.
12620/Bea/Of course it is.
12621/Mae/Hey! What does that mean?
12622/Gregg/Uuuuuuhm! Wuuuuuuuuhm!
12623/Mae/Well if any of this meant anything
12624/Mae/then it might mean something but it doesn't so
12625/Mae/...it doesn't.
12626/Gregg/Uuuuuuuhm? Wuuuuuuuuuhm?
12627/Bea/Uuuuuhmmhm!!! Wuuuuuumhmhmhm!
12628/Mae/What are you doing?
12629/Gregg/Whale noises.
12630/Gregg/Lucio! The fox!
12631/Gregg/They had to spear him to the ground to keep him down!
12632/Mae/Wait, keep him down? How so?
12633/Gregg/You know, in general!
12634/Gregg/Lucio the fox!
12635/Angus/Scourge of the french countryside!
12636/Gregg/Yeah, totally french. Totally a scourge.
12637/Mae/Why does he have a spear through him?
12638/Gregg/The candle that burns twice as bright gets speared through the guts!
12639/Angus/Beautiful.
12640/Angus/You can see why this one is so popular.
12641/Gregg/Got one of those right, huh Cap'n?
12642/Angus/Got a manly musk going here.
12643/Gregg/You smell like that stuff I got you, *FINALLY*.
12644/Gregg/Ice Hawk. It has a picture of an ice hawk on it.
12645/Angus/I smell quite masculine.
12646/Gregg/Like an ice hawk.
12647/Bea/I think you smell nice, Angus.
12648/Angus/thanks
12649/Mae/What's an ice hawk?
12650/Angus/...
12651/Angus/...
12652/Gregg/Aw Cap, you're not even.
12653/Mae/oh my god you're actually sad i didn't mean anything i'm sorry don't cry angus!
12654/Bea/Angus, you're really nice and smart and stuff.
12655/Gregg/Don't listen to Mae. She's perpetually angry.
12656/Mae/Ok I'm sorry I'll leave.
12657/Mae/Why can't I leave? And how am I not freezing?
12658/Angus/It's ok Mae. Just had a long year is all.
12659/Gregg/Aw dude, it'll be better next year.
12660/Mae/Go Angus! I'm on Team Angus!
12661/Gregg/Me too! I'm team captain and designated makeout partner!
12662/Bea/Me too! But not the makeout part. I'm... team treasurer?
12663/Angus/Can I be the mascot?
12664/Gregg/What? Germ! Germ that hangs out! Germ!
12665/Bea/Where is Germ?
12666/Gregg/Doing god knows what with whatever weird family he has.
12667/Bea/I imagine him secretly being some kind of trickster wizard...
12668/Bea/...who has assumed baffling form.
12669/Mae/I have no idea who you're talking about.
12670/Gregg/Oh no, Mae has Space Sickness! It took away her memory!
12671/Angus/Eject her from the airlock!
12672/Bea/Seriously Mae. He's Germ. You know Germ.
12673/Mae/Wait, are we in space? Why aren't I cold?
12674/Mae/Like Germ? Weird Germ?
12675/Gregg/...yes?
12676/Mae/How do you know...
12677/Bea/I think Mae's getting sleepy.
12678/Bea/I know, right?
12679/Bea/Talked. Out loud. In public.
12680/Mae/Oh is that all?
12681/Bea/That was enough apparently!
12682/Angus/Supposedly if you put your head underwater in some river in Italy
12683/Angus/she'll tell you about her murder.
12684/Angus/They renamed it the River Of Guilt.
12685/Bea/But not like the guilt of her murderers
12686/Bea/more like she's giving you a guilt trip or something stupid.
12687/Mae/This constellation is garbage.
12688/Bea/Chop my head off, I'll bite yours off!
12689/Gregg/Happy Longest Night, everyone!
12690/Angus/Moooooving on...
12691/Bea/Oh it's brilliant.
12692/Bea/It's like 21 hours long
12693/Bea/and like 100 years ago when it was playing in Bright Harbor
12694/Bea/the stage exploded during the part where Ibon crashes his balloon into the Wyrld Wyrm.
12695/Gregg/Sweeeeeet.
12696/Mae/Was anyone killed?
12697/Bea/Like a lot of people!
12698/Angus/Oh.
12699/Bea/Listen, if you can't laugh at that, I have bad news about the rest of history.
12700/Mae/We watched it when Mr. Olmers was out sick those two weeks.
12701/Mae/It's like super long!
12702/Bea/There's an awesome part where Ibon drinks the ocean to make the fish cry,
12703/Bea/so he can finally hear their voices and teach them to sing.
12704/Gregg/That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
12705/Bea/Yeah but it's the good kind of dumb.
12706/Bea/Opera is kinda like that all over.
12707/Gregg/What?!
12708/Mae/Mice are nature's snack cake.
12709/Mae/If you follow the food chain all the way down
12710/Mae/you will find mice.
12711/Mae/I'm sorry, Greggory, but your days are numbered.
12712/Gregg/No way, man. I'm forever!
12713/Gregg/Accurate.
12714/Lori/Hey killer.
12715/Mae/Geez! Who are you?
12716/Lori/Lori M.
12717/Mae/How do you know about the whole "killer" thing?
12718/Lori/You're kind of a local celebrity to some of us.
12719/Mae/ok.
12720/Mae/Have I seen you around somewhere before?
12721/Lori/I dunno. I'm up here most days.

12730/Mae/How do you even know about the “Killer” thing?
12731/Lori/It was a big deal, even to us middle schoolers.
12732/Not Stated/Yeah well. That was a long time ago.
12733/Lori/Why did you do it?
12734/Mae/I don’t know.
12735/Lori/Did he have it coming?
12736/Mae/No.
12737/Lori/Our mothers told us not to talk to you.
12738/Lori/Because no one knew when you were gonna do it again.
12739/Not Stated/And what did the middle schoolers say
12740/Lori/You put him in the hospital.
12741/Lori/And no one knows why.
12742/Lori/Did he like have it coming or something?
12743/Mae/No.
12744/Lori/Our mothers told us not to talk to you.
12745/Lori/Because no one knew when you were gonna do it again.
12746/Mae/Well, say hi to your mom for me. She sounds lovely.
12747/Lori/Oh, she's gone.
12748/Mae/Oh. Sorry.
12749/Lori/It's fine.

12757/Mae/I'm just gettin' old. 20 years. e_malĝojeta

12760/Lori/15 in February.
12761/Mae/I used to hang out here after school.
12762/Lori/Really? Most kids don't come all the way up here.
12763/Mae/Ha ha. That's why it's so nice. e_ĝoja e_krinĝega

13239/Lori/The train shakes my room at night.
13240/Mae/Yeah in the winter I can hear it. e_ĝoja
13241/Mae/One of my favorite noises.
13242/Lori/Well you don't have to wake up with bits of ceiling on you.

13247/Mae/Cool
13248/Mae/Speaking of nothing, did you see the tunnel got hecked up?
13249/Lori/Yeah, weird right?
13250/Lori/Town council and that cop pretty much chased everyone out earlier.
13251/Mae/I was wondering where all the kids were.
13252/Lori/Heh heh. They're all older than me.
13253/Lori/My sister hangs out with them.
13254/Mae/e_preta e_krinĝa
13255/Not Stated/Maybe I should ask your sister about it.
13256/Lori/I don't think she knows anything.
13257/Mae/Yeah, you're probably right.
13258/Mae/Any idea where she hangs out?
13259/Lori/um... she's in the tunnel a lot...
13260/Lori/when there isn't a cop hanging out.
13261/Mae/Fair.
13262/Not Stated/Any idea who did it?
13263/Lori/Maybe that one guy? Steve?
13264/Mae/Steve?
13265/Lori/Yeah. Like he's out of school
13266/Lori/but like still comes to school parties.
13267/Lori/Hits on girls in my class.

13308/Dad/Here's my hangover cure:
13309/Dad/not drinking the night before.
13310/Mae/wow. hold on, let me write that down.

13312/Dad/What did you do tonight?
13313/Mae/Um.
13314/Mae/Helped Gregg move some stuff.
13315/Dad/Look at what a good friend you are.
13316/Dad/Helping someone move is quite a gesture.
13317/Mae/Well, we've been best friends since like
13318/Mae/forever.
13319/Mae/So I feel like we're well past that point.
13320/Mae/I am really, really sore though.
13321/Dad/Sometimes you gotta get sore for friends.
13322/Mae/Went out with Bea.
13323/Dad/You have a good time?

13338/Mae/Went through the ravine by the old mill.
13339/Mae/Almost died.

13341/Mae/Yeah logs almost killed me.
13342/Mae/Normal stuff.
13343/Dad/Well, I promise you I'll never leave you stranded again.
13344/Mae/Tell you what.
13345/Mae/How about we pretend I did come home tonight.
13346/Mae/And we just got back from the bus station.

13368/Dad/Just like... an arm?
13369/Dad/What?
13370/Mae/Aunt Mall Cop came and everything!

13383/Mom/Tacos!
13384/Dad/Do you want Tacos?
13385/Not Stated/I want tacos. Every day. All day.

13388/Mae/...
13389/Mom/Honey no.
13390/Dad/What?
13391/Mae/I am so angry right now.
13392/Dad/You’ve all turned against me.
13393/Mom/Mae honey do you want sour cream on your taco?
13394/Mae/I.
13395/Mae/Want.
13396/Mae/Everything.
13397/Dad/Did you mean snake it up?
13398/Mom/Watch out for snakes, honey.
13399/Mae/Guys there's gonna be a fire and people.
13400/Mae/Snakes will be running in terror.
13401/Dad/Snakes don't run, kitten.
13402/Mom/Can you imagine snakes with legs?
13403/Mom/*shiver*
13404/Mae/Those are lizards, mom.
13405/Mom/Watch out for lizards then.
13406/Dad/They'll getcha.
13407/Mae/Great-grandad's clock.
13408/Mae/It's from the old country!
13409/Mae/It's never really worked.
13410/Mae/There are a few things hanging around in here from the Old Country.
13411/Mae/This clock, the trunk in the storage room
13412/Mae/and whatever is buried under the house after the cement incident.
13413/Mae/This thing goes off randomly every month or so.
13414/Mae/Little wooden duck pops out. Makes the weirdest sound.
13415/Mae/Scares dad half to death every time.
13416/Mae/Used to joke it was Grandad getting even with him from beyond the grave.
13417/Mae/Don't need the bathroom at the moment.
13418/Mae/Tooth-brushing is for kissers.
13419/Mae/I hate walking downstairs and finding out someone is in there.
13420/Mae/I feel like I've stomped all over their right to privacy.
13421/Mae/I will use the bathroom when I feel like it.
13422/Mae/Which is not now.
13423/Mae/I think I've only been in mom and dad's room like once.
13424/Mae/Wait. That can't be right.
13425/Mae/What do I even remember about it?
13426/Mae/They have that creepy statue of naked people kissing
13427/Mae/on the table at the foot of the bed.
13428/Mae/NOPE
13429/Mae/My mom got a cedar chest from her mom.
13430/Mae/Some kind of heirloom.
13431/Mae/I think back in the old days you were supposed to fill it with a dowry?
13432/Mae/What is a dowry?
13433/Mae/I'll just leave mom and dad's room to the imagination a bit longer.
13434/Mom/...Mae?
13435/Mae/Yeah?
13436/Mom/Are you going to go out?
13437/Mae/Yeah!
13438/Mom/[wave]Come back to the kitchen for a second!
13439/Mae/Hey dadders.
13440/Dad/Why if it isn’t the Mayor of Possum Springs herself.
13441/Dad/What did you get up to today?
13442/Mae/Hung out with Angus a bit. You remember him?
13443/Dad/Oh yeah! I like Angus. He’s smart.
13444/Dad/In the old days I used to work with his dad.
13445/Dad/I know they fell on some hard times after we all got laid off.
13446/Dad/Used to see him at the bar…
13447/Mae/Yeah.
13448/Dad/After I stopped drinking I didn’t really see him as much.
13449/Dad/I wonder how he is.
13450/Dad/Did they find out anything about that arm?
13451/Mae/Not that I heard.
13452/Dad/huh. Well, be careful out there.
13453/Mae/Maybe I should carry mace or brass knuckles or something.
13454/Dad/Well it’d be a shame if you got into trouble
13455/Dad/and were unarmed.
13456/Mae/Naw, I think I’ll be ok.
13457/Dad/...
13458/Mae/What?
13459/Dad/...
13460/Mae/HA HA HA HA HA ok I get it.
13461/Dad/UN-ARMED??? EH??
13462/Mae/I’m going to bed now.
13463/Dad/Goodnight Mayor Kitten.
13464/Mae/Goodnight!
13465/Mae/If I don't get out of this room I am probably going [speed=.7][color=999]to burn it down with me in it.
13466/Mae/I bet someone has done that. For like [color=999]political reasons.
13467/Mae/I wonder what would be left if I did [speed=.7][color=999]burn the room down with me in it?
13468/Mae/Bones probably. Copper pipes. [speed=.7][color=999]A shrieking phantom.
13469/Mae/"Yeah, this is a good location"
13470/Mae/"but I hear there was once a house here and a girl burned it down."
13471/Mae/"[speed=.5][color=999]With her inside it.[/all]"
13472/Mae/"We like to mention that to potential buyers."
13473/Mae/"There is a lot of screaming."
13474/Mae/"[speed=.7][color=999]I mean was."
13475/Mae/In fact, she did it on a night [speed=.7][color=999]JUST LIKE TONIGHT...
13476/Mae/And that's why I should [wave]go outside.
13477/Mae/
13478/Dad/You're on the couch!
13479/Mae/Hey Dad, would you mind moving the boxes in the crawlspace?
13480/Dad/Well what have you done for me lately?
13481/Not Stated/Been an excellent daughter.
13482/Not Stated/Been a credit to this family.
13483/Dad/That doesn't count.
13484/Dad/Well would you watch some TV with me?
13485/Mae/Um... what about those boxes I asked about? In the crawlspace?
13486/Dad/Hmm. I'm thinking about it.
13487/Dad/Watch some TV with me?
13488/Mae/So how about those crawlspace boxes?
13489/Dad/Yeah, okay. I'll move 'em.
13490/Dad/TV time?
13491/Dad/You staying up?
13492/Not Stated/Yeah for a little bit.
13493/Not Stated/Nah, I'm heading to bed.
13494/Dad/Hop up. I'm watching Garbo and Malloy.
13495/Dad/Perfect timing, Garbo and Malloy is starting.
13496/Mae/Niiiiiiice.
13497/Mae/Aw yes.
13498/Dad/Sounds like a plan.
13499/Mae/How's work?
13500/Dad/Ya know. Better than the glass factory!
13501/Mae/Is it?
13502/Dad/I've mined, I've ran machines,
13503/Dad/but now I get to slice steaks
13504/Dad/and hock salamis.
13505/Dad/I mean, it's easier on the back that's for sure.
13506/Mae/But like, do you like it?
13507/Dad/I like havin' a paycheck!
13508/Mae/Fair.
13509/Dad/Paychecks: the sweetest meats of all.
13510/Dad/What'd you do tonight?
13511/Mae/Oh ya know. Stuff.
13512/Mae/tired.
13513/Mae/Feel like I just did a day's work.
13514/Dad/You know, there are places you can get paid for work these days.
13515/Mae/Oh really?
13516/Dad/Yeah, they call it working.
13517/Mae/Huh. You kids with your slang.
13518/Dad/Slang you could pick up at work.

13527/Dad/Pleasant surprise seeing you at work tonight
13528/Mae/Yeah! I can't believe I hadn't visited yet.
13529/Dad/Well you haven't been back long.
13530/Dad/And you're not usually lurking at the Ham Panther.
13531/Mae/Who's to say I'm not?
13532/Dad/Well it was nice seeing you anyway.
13533/Mae/Lurk lurk.
13534/Mae/Any idea what was up with mom today?
13535/Dad/Oh, she's just stressed.
13536/Mae/You seem a little stressed tonight.
13537/Dad/Yeeeep. A bit stressed.
13538/Mae/Stressed about...
13539/Dad/Oh, just stuff.
13540/Mae/That's vague.
13541/Dad/Ha ha, well.
13542/Dad/I hate to be the one to break it to you
13543/Dad/but you spend a lot of adulthood being vaguely stressed.
13544/Mae/Aw dang.
13545/Mae/I thought the stress would at least get more specific.
13546/Dad/Oh no you'll have that too.
13547/Mae/hrm.
13548/Dad/Cheer up, kiddo. It's only life.
13549/Mae/Gee, thanks pop.

13600/Dad/Always running and jumping around all crazy
13601/Mae/I dunno. I mean I'm really out of shape.
13602/Mae/I don't think I've ever been *in* shape.

13718/TV/no, i mean those old nights, those good nights
13719/TV/just the heat of the stagelights and the thrill of winging it!
13720/TV/and the gentle thump of an empty beer bottle thrown at your head!
13721/TV/These days things are pretty cushy!
13722/TV/You think we’re getting soft?
13723/TV/You sure are… AROUND THE MIDSECTION
13724/TV/“that’s a whoppah!”

13882/Mae/let's see what the back of the book says.
13883/Mae/Released in 1937,
13884/Mae/"Shapes From Beyond The Veil Of Space" is a towering achievement
13885/Mae/and marks the start of the weird gothic genre.
13886/Mae/an influence on much of 20th and 21st century horror,
13887/Mae/science fiction,
13888/Mae/and pulp literature,
13889/Mae/"Shapes" is sure to make you question
13890/Mae/just how far away the night sky is
13891/Mae/from you
13892/Mae/at this moment.
13893/Mae/Cool.
13894/Mae/There are a few things hanging around in here from the Old Country.
13895/Mae/This clock, the trunk in the storage room
13896/Mae/and whatever is buried under the house after the cement incident.
13897/Mae/This thing goes off randomly every month or so.
13898/Mae/Little wooden duck pops out. Makes the weirdest sound.
13899/Mae/Scares dad half to death every time.
13900/Mae/Used to joke it was Granddad getting even with him from beyond the grave.
13901/Mae/god. this thing is intense.
13902/Mae/weird how big clocks are like
13903/Mae/luxury furniture now
13904/Mae/since everything has a clock and internet on it.
13905/Mae/like having something big that only does one thing
13906/Mae/is like
13907/Mae/a statement or something.
13908/Mae/Wonder how old this thing is?
13909/Mae/I wonder if the new working clock downstairs
13910/Mae/thinks this clock is scary.
13911/Mae/Big old thing upstairs
13912/Mae/Like you, but different, huge, and spooky
13913/Mae/making weird noises at night.
13914/Mae/Aw, I can't find this thing spooky.
13915/Mae/It's a piece of granddad.
13916/Mae/we need more of those.
13917/Mae/Hey Granddad's clock.
13918/Mae/Hey Granddad.
13919/Mae/Hmm, an old safe.

13934/Mae/Oh holy shit.

13944/Mae/Finally! Dad's gonna move these.

13951/Mae/dad should move 'em.
13952/Mae/it's only fair!|
13953/Mae/If I don't get out of this room I am probably going [speed=.7][color=999]to burn it down with me in it.

14091/Not Stated/Nope. It burned down
14092/Not Stated/Not for me at least.
14093/Twigmeyer/I always thought you'd either go on to do great things
14094/Twigmeyer/or sit on your ass here until it put down roots.
14095/Mae/Ass roots?
14096/Twigmeyer/Guess I can settle that one in my mind.
14097/Mae/...
14098/Mae/...see you around...
14099/Twigmeyer/Well I'm sure you burned it down.
14100/Mae/These allegations, Mr. Twigmeyer.
14101/Twigmeyer/I ain't allegatin'
14102/Twigmeyer/Just try not to burn my lawn down, you firebug.
14103/Mae/No promises.
14104/Twigmeyer/Well it looks like Mae.
14105/Twigmeyer/Bet it smells like Mae.
14106/Mae/I have a smell?
14107/Twigmeyer/When you were a kid,
14108/Twigmeyer/Susan used to call you a little dirtball.
14109/Not Stated/Well I was a dirtball.
14110/Not Stated/I was never a dirtball.
14111/Twigmeyer/You still are a dirtball I bet.
14112/Mae/Cradle to grave. 100 percent dirtball.
14113/Twigmeyer/That's the spirit!
14114/Mae/See you around, Mr. Twigmeyer!
14115/Twigmeyer/Aw Mae, you were our dirtball.
14116/Mae/Every child's dream.
14117/Twigmeyer/See? Count your every blessing.
14118/Mae/Well, you can *COUNT* on seeing me around tomorrow.
14119/Twigmeyer/Feel free to rake my lawn.
14120/Mae/You paying?
14121/Twigmeyer/Get out of here, dirtball.
14122/Mae/Well it sure is fall.
14123/Mae/All the roadwork crammed in before winter.
14124/Mae/Makes like half the town inaccessible.
14125/Mae/Unless you wanna walk the long way around
14126/Mae/for like 20 minutes.
14127/Mae/Which, I mean, no.
14128/Mae/Hey Mr. Twigmeyer!
14129/Twigmeyer/
14130/Mae/Alright then!
14131/Mae/Rake 'em good, Mr. Twigmeyer!
14132/Penderson/HEY! YOU KID!
14133/Mae/Adult.
14134/Penderson/So you’re back, eh?
14135/Mae/Yes, Mr. Penderson.
14136/Penderson/Didn’t last long, eh?
14137/Mae/No, Mr. Penderson
14138/Penderson/You get a job yet?
14139/Not Stated/I’ve only been back for like 24 hours.
14140/Not Stated/Yes. I’ve been elected mayor.
14141/Penderson/Soon it'll be "only a week"
14142/Penderson/then a month
14143/Penderson/then your whole life.
14144/Mae/You're right. I have so much time left. e_krinĝega e_ĝoja
14145/Mae/e_mira e_neûtrala_1
14146/Penderson/Hhmph. Couldn't do worse than the current one.
14147/Mae/And I've ordered your house to be bulldozed.
14148/Penderson/What, finishing the job you started?
14149/Mae/I hope you enjoy living in the woods!
14150/Penderson/Those eggs took the paint off the vinyl siding.
14151/Mae/Scavenge food! Commune with the beasts, Mr. Penderson!
14152/Penderson/Watch yourself, lil miss.
14153/Mae/"Lil. Effing. Miss?"
14154/Penderson/No one's forgotten who you are and what you did, you know.
14155/Penderson/They may act like they have.
14156/Penderson/But that's just small town polite right there.
14157/Mae/Is that what this is?
14158/Penderson/Small town polite's all you got kid.
14159/Penderson/So watch it.
14160/Mae/Well that was really interesting
14161/Mae/but I need to go listen to my cells die.
14162/Penderson/PAH!
14163/Mae/PAH!
14164/Penderson/...freeloadin' trash mammals...
14165/Molly/Hey Mae.
14166/Mae/What?
14167/Molly/I was just stopping by to see how you were doing.
14168/Mae/Why?
14169/Molly/After the other night I mean.
14170/Mae/Why wouldn’t I be fine?
14171/Molly/Mae, a lot of things that happen around here,
14172/Molly/sometimes in town, sometimes out by the tracks,
14173/Molly/sometimes up in the hills...
14174/Molly/...
14175/Mae/What?
14176/Molly/It's my job to make sure folks like you
14177/Molly/never see something like what you saw the other night.
14178/Not Stated/You’re not doing a very good job of it.
14179/Not Stated/"Folks like you"?
14180/Molly/Better than you might think.
14181/Mae/I’ve been back less than 3 days and I already saw dead body parts.
14182/Mae/Which wasn't a big deal, but
14183/Molly/You didn't see Tom Jennings shoot his brother in the stomach
14184/Molly/last night out on Doty Line Road. Out past Arner.
14185/Molly/You didn't have to walk out into that cornfield.
14186/Mae/Geez.
14187/Molly/You're a kid, Mae.
14188/Molly/And you're naive.
14189/Molly/And in its own stupid way, that's beautiful.
14190/Molly/But the world isn't.
14191/Molly/And the world isn’t out there somewhere.
14192/Molly/It's here.
14193/Mae/Alright, are you gonna arrest me or something?
14194/Mae/Because I have a party to go to.
14195/Molly/Watch yourself, Mae.
14196/Molly/I'd really hate to see something happen to you.
14197/Molly/And being in the wrong place at the wrong time is all it takes.
14198/Mae/...
14199/Molly/That's all I'm saying.
14200/Mae/That's ominous.
14201/Molly/Good night, Mae.
14202/Harley1/Kill Kill Kill!
14203/Harley3/FBI freeze!
14204/Mae/Nah, not feelin' the graveyard today.
14205/Mae/I feel like you might need Bea for the full graveyard experience.
14206/Mae/That was not a joke about her mother.
14207/Mae/e_krinĝega
14208/Mae/oh god.
14209/Mae/what do *YOU* want?
14210/Molly/hello to you too, mae.
14211/Mae/well?
14212/Molly/I wanted to let you know.
14213/Molly/we ran a test on that arm you guys found a few days back.
14214/Mae/e_mira
14215/Mae/oh really???
14216/Molly/yeah. thought you'd be interested is all.
14217/Mae/definitely!
14218/Molly/arm belonged to a middle aged man
14219/Molly/and medium build.
14220/Molly/and he was dead when it was removed.
14221/Mae/whoa.
14222/Mae/that means...
14223/Molly/it doesn't mean anything yet.
14224/Molly/i just thought you'd like to know.
14225/Molly/you always liked detective stories when you were a kid.
14226/Mae/ok. yeah. thanks.
14227/Mae/this ghost is seriously messed up.
14228/Molly/ghost?
14229/Molly/wasn't no ghost involved in this, whatever it was.
14230/Mae/yeah yeah. nobody believes me. i get it.
14231/Molly/be careful, mae.
14232/Molly/strange stuff going on.
14233/Mae/yeah you're telling me.
14234/Molly/have a nice evening, mae.
14235/Mae/I remember the time in 9th grade
14236/Mae/when I snuck out and could see into Tom Bramwell's bedroom.
14237/Mae/e_malĝojeta
14238/Mae/Yep that sure did happen. e_neûtrala_1
14239/Mae/When the flood happened that one year this pole fell over
14240/Mae/and I was scared it’d somehow electrify the water all over the neighborhood
14241/Mae/and it’d stay that way
14242/Mae/and I was kinda afraid of taking a shower
14243/Mae/or turning on the faucet for weeks.
14244/Mae/hey dad.
14245/Mae/no work today?
14246/Dad/i told bob to shove it.
14247/Mae/e_ĝoja

14256/Dad/i’ve mined, i’ve made glass, i’ve done a heap other stuff.
14257/Dad/but this place… they just don’t respect you for workin’.
14258/Mae/they don’t?
14259/Dad/Job’s s’posed to pay you enough to live
14260/Dad/Job’s s’posed to let you provide for your family
14261/Dad/Job’s s’posed to have regular hours
14262/Dad/Boss’ s’posed to respect you.
14263/Dad/Workers s’posed to be able to talk
14264/Dad/Workers s’posed to be able to have a life
14265/Dad/Workers s’posed to be able to live.
14266/Dad/Your mom always had to work but
14267/Dad/I wanted to give you and her your time
14268/Dad/I wanted her to have hobbies
14269/Dad/and enough time and money to do them
14270/Dad/that’s what made me happy
14271/Dad/now i just work so i can keep our health insurance
14272/Dad/and hold onto the house. Try to at least.
14273/Mae/my friend Germ
14274/Mae/his dad works for department of transportation
14275/Mae/he talked about you getting a union going at Ham Panther
14276/Dad/they fire you just for talking about it
14277/Mae/is that legal?
14278/Dad/legal don’t always matter.
14279/Mae/is there anything you can do?
14280/Dad/i mean, we *do* need a union
14281/Dad/it’s just easier to say it than get it done
14282/Dad/unions were always there in the mines and the factory
14283/Dad/least for a while
14284/Dad/but here…
14285/Mae/i got something for ya

14326/Twigmeyer/Hello.
14327/Mae/Raking the... uh...

14329/Not Stated/Nothing?
14330/Twigmeyer/Lawns are like people.
14331/Mae/and trees are like friends. Or something.
14332/Twigmeyer/Ok.
14333/Mae/Wait. How are lawns like people?

14336/Twigmeyer/so I’m out here putting in that good time.
14337/Mae/Huh.
14338/Mae/You have a pretty strong bond with your grass.
14339/Twigmeyer/Heh heh well I grab hold of just about everything I can.
14340/Mae/After the flood it laid in our yard for 2 weeks
14341/Mae/like a big dead... thing.
14342/Mae/But then they put it back up
14343/Mae/and I could see it from my window at night
14344/Mae/and it felt spooky for some reason.
14345/Mae/Spooky pole.
14346/Mae/Undead friend.
14347/Mae/Watching me from the curb.

14425/Molly/just... be careful.
14426/Mae/well geez until now i never considered that!
14427/Molly/MAE!
14428/Mae/ok fine thanks bye
14429/Mae/Whoever lives here is certainly a churchgoer.
14430/Mae/Five saints.
14431/Mae/Grandmama had a setup like this
14432/Mae/last time I saw her.
14433/Mae/"Icons are good for keeping the good in"
14434/Mae/"and the bad out."
14435/Mae/This is the super-important info I retained
14436/Mae/from years of sunday school.
14437/Mae/In the end Grandmama died, while the saints watched.
14438/Mae/It was time.
14439/Mae/And they weren't saints anyway.
14440/Mae/They were pictures.
14441/Mae/Pour one out for Grandmama.
14442/Mae/Must be weird to sleep in this bed every night.
14443/Mae/Alone in the building.
14444/Mae/Except for Telezoft a couple floors down.
14445/Mae/maybe they work there.
14446/Mae/just come downstairs in their pajamas
14447/Mae/hey everybody i just woke up and i live at work.
14448/Mae/oh god this sounds horrible.
14449/Mae/I could sleep in this bed.
14450/Mae/and whoever lives here would never know.
14451/Mae/they’d go to sleep
14452/Mae/tonight
14453/Mae/unaware someone else was just there
14454/Mae/under their sheets
14455/Mae/on their pillow.
14456/Mae/mwa ha ha ha.
14457/Mae/i could also like
14458/Mae/be helpful
14459/Mae/i could make their bed when they don’t.
14460/Mae/this doesn’t have to be creepy.
14461/Mae/I could hide in here until whoever lives here gets back.
14462/Mae/And possibly give them a heart attack.
14463/Mae/Or get shot in the face. With a gun.
14464/Mae/What am I doing in here?
14465/Mae/What am I doing with my life?
14466/Mae/I'm sitting in a stranger's closet
14467/Mae/in a nearly-vacant building.
14468/Mae/I could just stay in here.
14469/Mae/Just forever be here forever.
14470/Mae/Where does this person pee?
14471/Mae/It's dark in here.
14472/Mae/what’s even in this closet?
14473/Mae/i feel some shoes.
14474/Mae/some shirts i think.
14475/Mae/ok they’ve got a golf club or something
14476/Mae/oh weird. They have a sword in here?
14477/Mae/i could take the sword and rob a bank?
14478/Mae/hands up, citizen! I’ll jam this sword in your neck!
14479/Mae/ha ha. I could wear a mask and a cape.
14480/Mae/“who was that dashing thief?
14481/Mae/that threatened to stab the bank teller in the neck?”
14482/Mae/Ugh. My life is a wreck.
14483/Mae/I’d probably stab my *own* neck on accident.
14484/Mae/get it together, Mae.
14485/Mae/but seriously where does this person pee?
14486/Mae/I wonder if whoever lives here knows I’ve been here.
14487/Mae/I feel like we have some relationship
14488/Mae/like I’m a ghost
14489/Mae/and I’m haunting them.
14490/Mae/I should like
14491/Mae/Move something.
14492/Mae/just to let them know someone cares
14493/Mae/enough to visit them.
14494/Mae/ok I’m not gonna do that.
14495/Mae/that would be the creepiest thing ever.
14496/Mae/After the parade got canned there wasn't much going on in the spring.
14497/Mae/But we still did the easter basket blessing at the church.
14498/Mae/And ate special pretzels. We didn't bother to bless those.
14499/Mae/Profane pretzels.
14500/Mae/Oh my god. These flowers are fake as hell.
14501/Mae/Mallard deserves a better memorial.
14502/Mae/Wow. So this is where this stuff ended up.
14503/Mae/I remember the spring parade. It was so much fun.
14504/Mae/Until the year that Mallard P. Bloomingro snapped his tether and ran over Chris Evans.
14505/Mae/Then they canceled the parade.
14506/Mae/Cowards.
14507/Mae/They couldn't cage Mallard. Mallard needed to be free.
14508/Mae/And neither ropes nor the poor legs of Chris Evans could hold him back.
14509/Mae/I wonder what happened to both of them.
14510/Mae/*Who lives here?*
14511/Mae/It's, like, just a room.
14512/Mae/One fridge.
14513/Mae/One dresser.
14514/Mae/One lamp.
14515/Mae/One bed.
14516/Mae/One window.
14517/Mae/One door.
14518/Mae/I guess that makes two ways out.
14519/Mae/This would be creepy if it wasn't so spooky.
14520/Mae/Tell Alec to fix the code.
14521/Mae/seriously. There’s no bathroom in here.
14522/Mae/and none outside this room.
14523/Mae/do they poop in this dresser?!
14524/Mae/oh god...
14525/Mae/do they poop in a bucket?????
14526/Mae/oh geez what if I stumble across the poop bucket.
14527/Mae/there are unanswered questions here.
14528/Mae/wonder if it’s a guy or a gal
14529/Mae/they’re probably pretty old

14997/Mae/They’ve uh...
14998/Mae/They’ve got a lot of elevators in here.
14999/Gregg/That’s really weird.
15000/Gregg/Hm.
15001/Gregg/Locked.
15002/Mae/I think this is as high as we’re going without picking some locks, so
15003/Gregg/AW, CRAP
15004/Mae/You’re kidding me.
15005/Gregg/Dropped the lockpick stuff out back.
15006/Mae/You’re *KIDDING* me.
15007/Gregg/I WAS BEING ATTACKED BY AN OWL!!!
15008/Mae/Ok.
15009/Mae/Sorry.
15010/Mae/Can you like, improvise?
15011/Gregg/Um. Need some pliers...
15012/Gregg/and...
15013/Gregg/you got a paperclip?
15014/Mae/Uh, no. Who walking around on earth today is carrying a paperclip?
15015/Mae/Hey! Bet that office has one!
15016/Gregg/i bet they use paper and need to like
15017/Gregg/clip that shit?
15018/Mae/nice nice nice.
15019/Gregg/Nobody.
15020/Mae/so like, ok, just so I got this straight now...
15021/Gregg/shoot
15022/Mae/Map Room, Forbidden Zone, Find A Way Out, Find Pliers, Find Paperclip
15023/Gregg/I think that’s it
15024/Mae/THIS IS SO STUPID!!!
15025/Mae/This is like work! This is all work!
15026/Gregg/Did you hear that?
15027/Mae/yeah...
15028/Mae/didn’t sound like a person
15029/Gregg/yeah. I don’t know what that was.
15030/Mae/ok well, let’s hurry.
15031/Mae/Holy shit are we in the basement?
15032/Gregg/Oh ok.
15033/Mae/oh hey! That’s where that elevator goes?
15034/Gregg/this elevator.
15035/Mae/holy crap, i didn’t even notice this when we came in?
15036/Gregg/huh. There’s another one over there too.
15037/Mae/yeah so...
15038/Gregg/this doesn’t make a lot of sense
15039/Mae/Maybe like
15040/Mae/this elevator is for loading things for the map room?
15041/Mae/and like... they use the other one to avoid the stairs...
15042/Mae/but even then,
15043/Gregg/Dude, none of this makes sense.
15044/Gregg/It doesn’t look like whatever that is is following us down here.
15045/Mae/“whatever?” not “whoever?”
15046/Gregg/whoever
15047/Mae/are you coming around on this ghost thing?
15048/Gregg/ghosts don’t use elevators
15049/Mae/why? So a ghost can walk up stairs or something
15050/Mae/but elevators are out of the question?
15051/Gregg/...
15052/Gregg/so the question I have is
15053/Gregg/where does that one go?
15054/Mae/ok
15055/Gregg/crimes?
15056/Mae/crimes.
15057/Mae/ok
15058/Gregg/here we go
15059/Mae/It’s locked!!!! Something locked it!!
15060/Gregg/SomeONE.
15061/Mae/We can go back upstairs?
15062/Mae/Actually no, we’re just gonna get chased around in a circle
15063/Mae/by whatever it is.
15064/Gregg/Whoever it is.
15065/Mae/DUDE.
15066/Gregg/aaaaaaand...
15067/Gregg/Got it!
15068/Mae/We don’t know where this is gonna go.
15069/Gregg/Got any better ideas?
15070/Mae/DUDE. Clearly I don’t.
15071/Mae/Stuck!
15072/Mae/we are so screwed!
15073/Gregg/i'm working i'm working!
15074/Gregg/oh hey it's my neighborhood.
15075/Mae/and the highway.

15089/Gregg/quite.
15090/Mae/aw. i think that's the old food donkey.
15091/Gregg/and the woods your ghost guy ran into?
15092/Mae/yep.
15093/Gregg/he sure gets around for a dead guy.
15094/Mae/that he does.
15095/Mae/Augh it's alive!
15096/Gregg/geez that thing's ugly.
15097/Mae/Well this was the source of the noise I guess.
15098/Gregg/Mystery solved.
15099/Gregg/wait
15100/Gregg/no
15101/Gregg/if it was making that noise that means
15102/Gregg/that someone was in here
15103/Gregg/while we were walking around.
15104/Mae/ohhhh

15262/Bea/i have no idea what to even think about any of this
15263/Mae/it’s just... horror?
15264/Angus/that's not a word you get to use too often.
15265/Mae/that’s all i’ve got left
15266/Mae/like, everything else in my head is gone
15267/Gregg/let’s get out of here, fast
15268/Gregg/my brain is in pieces right now
15269/Mae/it’s all just empty
15270/Mae/everything’s empty
15271/Mae/what are we going to do
15272/Gregg/we’ll crack that one when we’re far away from here
15273/Mae/I don’t know if I...
15274/Angus/shhh

15279/HeadMiner/take a couple more steps forward if you wanna die.
15280/Bea/show yourself!
15281/Gregg/yeah asshole we’re like 5 times scarier than you
15282/Eide/there they are! They’re right there!
15283/Eide/I'm gonna kill them!
15284/HeadMiner/Eide, you'll do no such thing.
15285/HeadMiner/It's out of your hands now.
15286/Eide/he... shot... me!
15287/HeadMiner/Then I’d say we're even.
15288/HeadMiner/Little girl got shot at the other night.
15289/Miner1/Yeah. Sorry about that.
15290/Mae/You're... apologizing?
15291/Miner1/It was a bad call. I am sorry.
15292/Mae/Uh. It's ok?
15293/Mae/It didn’t actually hit me, so-
15294/Mae/Wait. What the- Who are you?
15295/HeadMiner/Buncha of old boys doing their damnedest
15296/HeadMiner/to protect their own and their neighbors.
15297/Mae/Th-... then. why are you trying to kill me?
15298/Miner2/Kill you?!
15299/Miner1/Nobody's gonna kill you!
15300/HeadMiner/All of you are part of this town.
15301/HeadMiner/by family relation or just by being hard workers.
15302/Miner2/Contributors!
15303/Mae/Um. ok.
15304/Mae/so we could just leave?
15305/HeadMiner/Well, *he* brought you down here for a reason
15306/HeadMiner/and he’s not gonna let you leave until he’s had his say.
15307/Mae/Well *he’s* already got an arrow through the shoulder.
15308/Mae/I don’t think he’s gonna be having much say in whatever.
15309/HeadMiner/…
15310/Miner1/...
15311/HeadMiner/Wait. So you think that Eide-
15312/Mae/He kidnapped that kid at Harfest!
15313/Mae/He’s… been in my head somehow!
15314/Mae/I'm always tired! Constant headaches!
15315/Mae/He's been following me... following all of us!
15316/Mae/He-
15317/HeadMiner/Oh, little girl.
15318/HeadMiner/You don’t know what this is, do you?
15319/Mae/What?
15320/Mae/oh god
15321/Mae/i’ve seen this
15322/Mae/or I’ve… I’ve felt it…
15323/HeadMiner/Was Ed Skudder and Jim Dorney who found it.
15324/HeadMiner/20 years back or so.
15325/HeadMiner/After the west mine closed out past Briddle
15326/HeadMiner/Vest Schumacher. Last supervisor.
15327/HeadMiner/was out there when the company locked off the entrance
15328/HeadMiner/carved his initials and date in the door.
15329/HeadMiner/Then you got this mine, the Old One.
15330/HeadMiner/not even a proper mine. Big hole. Copper.
15331/HeadMiner/Abandoned, shoot, long before any of us were born.
15332/HeadMiner/too close to water.
15333/HeadMiner/And that water was poison
15334/HeadMiner/when the first settlers came out here.
15335/HeadMiner/that old spring used to be right above where we’re standin’.
15336/HeadMiner/but that water dried up.
15337/HeadMiner/1992 or so some men from west mine
15338/HeadMiner/come back up here to try bootleggin,
15339/HeadMiner/practically built a new elevator, got the main tunnel cleared
15340/HeadMiner/never found no coal, just dug deeper n' deeper
15341/HeadMiner/til Ed busts through that wall and finds this place
15342/HeadMiner/and Jim walks right into that hole
15343/HeadMiner/and never hits bottom.
15344/HeadMiner/Ed calls down to Jim
15345/HeadMiner/Jim don’t answer
15346/HeadMiner/but someone else does.
15347/HeadMiner/I know you heard that voice, girl.
15348/HeadMiner/In dreams and in waking times.
15349/HeadMiner/‘swhat brought you down here.
15350/Not Stated/what... what is it?
15351/HeadMiner/black goat
15352/HeadMiner/not even black like the color
15353/HeadMiner/black like the space between the stars
15354/HeadMiner/he’s down there, in that hole
15355/HeadMiner/looking up at us right now
15356/HeadMiner/he don’t talk to ya
15357/HeadMiner/he... sings...
15358/Mae/why would you just do something a hole in a cave told you to?
15359/Not Stated/so what does this have to do with you, or me, or anyone?
15360/HeadMiner/you got to understand
15361/HeadMiner/in those days it was the end of the world
15362/HeadMiner/jobs gone. Our kids were leaving.
15363/HeadMiner/government didn’t care, only wanted our votes.
15364/HeadMiner/just puttin in more regulations, sendin our jobs overseas,
15365/HeadMiner/spendin our taxes on lazy people 'n immigrants
15366/HeadMiner/while we worked ourselves to death.
15367/Bea/ugh here we go.
15368/Bea/goddamn i hate this crap.
15369/Bea/you old dipshits.
15370/HeadMiner/you finished?
15371/Bea/yeah sure.
15372/HeadMiner/we prayed and prayed up at the church,
15373/HeadMiner/but when Ed Skudder came back down here and listened
15374/HeadMiner/he got answers back.
15375/Not Stated/oh god… i think i know...
15376/HeadMiner/yeah he’s already in there singin to ya, right?
15377/Mae/I… I…
15378/Not Stated/answers?
15379/HeadMiner/Ed explained it to a few folks, and they didn’t believe it
15380/HeadMiner/but he was persuasive
15381/HeadMiner/he had the glimmer.
15382/Mae/"the glimmer?"
15383/Miner2/ones 'e takes a shining to
15384/Miner2/it rubs off on ya.
15385/Miner2/you can do things.
15386/HeadMiner/I never seen it
15387/HeadMiner/but they said Ed could walk through walls.
15388/Mae/ok.
15389/HeadMiner/after Ed talked us into all this,
15390/HeadMiner/after that first time, after we picked one out
15391/HeadMiner/well...
15392/HeadMiner/not only was the town holdin' stable
15393/HeadMiner/but it was almost like we were getting younger, and money came too
15394/HeadMiner/still a few of us left from back then
15395/Not Stated/“Picked”?
15396/HeadMiner/first one was Tom Turner, who believe you me was a bastard
15397/HeadMiner/just pure trash
15398/HeadMiner/we got him down here
15399/HeadMiner/and in the hole he went.
15400/HeadMiner/the next week, flowers bloomin’ all over the hills
15401/Not Stated/“First time?”
15402/HeadMiner/First one into the hole by our own hands.
15403/HeadMiner/We own up to what we do. I was there.
15404/Miner2/I was too.
15405/Bea/You throw them in the hole?
15406/Mae/...
15407/Mae/they’re... feeding him...
15408/HeadMiner/he's hungry like you wouldn't believe.
15409/HeadMiner/every few months or so he starts singin’
15410/HeadMiner/and it’s someone’s turn to find someone.
15411/Not Stated/was that what you were doing the other night?
15412/Miner1/No.
15413/HeadMiner/What happened the other night was a shame.
15414/HeadMiner/One of our number broke the rules.
15415/HeadMiner/an' had to pay up.
15416/HeadMiner/that was a hard thing to do
15417/Not Stated/...
15418/Mae/i think i’m gonna be sick...
15419/HeadMiner/we never pick noone who’s gonna be missed
15420/HeadMiner/that’s a solid rule.
15421/HeadMiner/Drifters, drunks, and delinquents.
15422/Mae/you’ve been… oh god… oh no...
15423/Not Stated/How many people have died down here???
15424/HeadMiner/oh, I’d say…
15425/Miner1/3 dozen. Give or take.
15426/Miner2/39.
15427/Miner2/am I the only one keeping steady count?
15428/HeadMiner/I do now. Early on I think we all wanted to forget.
15429/Miner1/i still got a feelin' heart. it still hurts.
15430/Miner2/yeah that dirtbag kid from the spring...
15431/Gregg/C...c...casey?
15432/Not Stated/Casey?
15433/HeadMiner/The Hartley kid?
15434/HeadMiner/all he was gonna contribute to society
15435/HeadMiner/'cept a buncha kids growin up with no dad
15436/HeadMiner/was a rap sheet a mile long
15437/HeadMiner/before whatever sad end he’d wind up at.
15438/HeadMiner/we did him a FAVOR.
15439/Gregg/You... k-killed... Casey? e_malĝoja
15440/Angus/oh my god.
15441/HeadMiner/we don’t use that word.
15442/HeadMiner/you know he was taking up business with his cousin, right?
15443/HeadMiner/you know what happened to his cousin?
15444/HeadMiner/burned alive when his little trailer lab exploded
15445/HeadMiner/they had to wear hazmat suits when they cleaned him up
15446/HeadMiner/that’s where Casey was headed.
15447/Gregg/You killed Casey.
15448/HeadMiner/and you want to act like we didn’t do him and this whole town a favor?
15449/Mae/oh god... Casey’s been down here the whole time.
15450/Mae/his parents put up posters!
15451/HeadMiner/maybe they shoulda cared more about him before it came to this.
15452/Gregg/e_neûtrala_1
15453/Gregg/WHICH ONE OF YOU DID IT!!! e_kria
15454/Bea/Gregg-
15455/Gregg/HE WAS MY FRIEND!!!! e_kria
15456/Miner1/Alright now. Throw it down right now or I will shoot.
15457/Gregg/e_ĝoja
15458/Gregg/heh heh
15459/Gregg/What if I get you first?
15460/Gregg/bolt stickin' right outta your eye
15461/Gregg/*bang*
15462/Gregg/*baaaaaaaaang*
15463/Gregg/e_neûtrala_1
15464/Angus/You brought guns down here?
15465/Miner2/Dangerous this far out in the woods at night. Basic safety.
15466/Gregg/I… I...
15467/Miner1/Throw it down, son.
15468/Miner1/Don’t make this our time.
15469/Bea/Gregg…
15470/Gregg/Dangit.
15471/Mae/you’re monsters
15472/Mae/none of this
15473/Mae/none of this is happening
15474/HeadMiner/we are not monsters
15475/HeadMiner/We do it because we love our home.
15476/HeadMiner/as long as we keep doing this,
15477/HeadMiner/Possum Springs survives
15478/HeadMiner/things *can* get better
15479/HeadMiner/these mines are gonna be humming again someday
15480/HeadMiner/old mills puffin’ smoke
15481/HeadMiner/you kids don’t understand that-
15482/HeadMiner/we lost what our world was built around
15483/HeadMiner/used to be you provided for a family, bought a house
15484/HeadMiner/now you’re stockin’ shelves at the grocery store
15485/HeadMiner/kids leavin’ more than they’re stayin’... No opportunity here.
15486/HeadMiner/old people dyin’, houses left empty
15487/HeadMiner/you ever seen that?
15488/HeadMiner/A *HOME* become a tumbled-in pile of wood and plaster?
15489/HeadMiner/A *JOB* become a burned out brick box or a hole in the ground?
15490/HeadMiner/but we can change that.
15491/HeadMiner/we can put this place back together,
15492/HeadMiner/where it won’t be just…
15493/Mae/shapes.
15494/Mae/i’m going to die down here
15495/Mae/why are you telling us all this?
15496/HeadMiner/Because we’re getting old
15497/HeadMiner/and even with the fringe benefit of good health
15498/HeadMiner/we need new blood
15499/HeadMiner/to carry this on when we’re gone.
15500/Bea/Really? You’re like, pitching us on this?
15501/Bea/were any of you even miners back in the day?
15502/Bea/any of you hurting now? financially, like?
15503/Bea/or is this just some big costume party murder club
15504/Bea/for someone's shitty boss who's afraid of dying?
15505/HeadMiner/that don't matter.
15506/Bea/*snort*
15507/Bea/it does.
15508/Angus/this is real bad.
15509/Gregg/this is insane.
15510/Not Stated/why should we help you?
15511/Not Stated/why shouldn’t we just call the cops?
15512/HeadMiner/And say... what?
15513/HeadMiner/you saw some men you can’t identify
15514/HeadMiner/in an abandoned mine behind a locked gate
15515/HeadMiner/and an elevator that won’t run?
15516/HeadMiner/that you saw a… hole?
15517/Mae/ok fine. Why should we help you?
15518/HeadMiner/because if no one is here to do this
15519/HeadMiner/you remember that flood a few years back?
15520/HeadMiner/you remember the blizzard of 2010?
15521/HeadMiner/that’s what happens.
15522/HeadMiner/and beyond that
15523/HeadMiner/the jobs never come back. The kids never come back.
15524/HeadMiner/everything crumbles. Possum Springs bleeds to death.
15525/HeadMiner/and soon we’ll all be dead
15526/HeadMiner/and this town will just be fields and trees.
15527/Mae/I’ve... seen it.
15528/HeadMiner/I know you have.
15529/HeadMiner/I’ll understand if you need some time to think it over.
15530/Bea/so we can leave?
15531/HeadMiner/no one’s gonna stop you.
15532/HeadMiner/but understand that you don’t know who we are
15533/HeadMiner/out there
15534/HeadMiner/but we know who you all are
15535/Eide/ain’t fair they get to leave and I probably got permanent damage
15536/HeadMiner/shut it, eide!
15537/Eide/you don’t know a thing about what he wants! What he is!
15538/HeadMiner/eide i swear to god
15539/Bea/let’s go
15540/Gregg/yeah let's seriously get out of here
15541/HeadMiner/son, you leave that crossbow.
15542/Gregg/what? why?
15543/HeadMiner/well, i could bullshit you
15544/HeadMiner/but the truth is i just don't trust you.
15545/Gregg/fine whatever. It's a piece of shit anyway.
15546/HeadMiner/heh heh.
15547/Mae/I... I can’t move you guys
15548/Angus/I’ll carry you.
15549/Gregg/aaaaaaaaaw geez
15550/Bea/what is this place?
15551/Angus/looks like a church or something?
15552/Bea/and like... junk...
15553/Mae/oh god...

15562/Angus/ok. well.
15563/Bea/Angus! you saved us!
15564/Angus/uh i mean i found fresh air.
15565/Angus/it might just be a nicer place to starve to death.
15566/Mae/dying anywhere other than in here is nice.
15567/Bea/I just wanna die anywhere else
15568/Mae/nice.
15569/Gregg/nice.
15570/Angus/nice.
15571/Angus/looks like he took the elevator down.
15572/Angus/so much for the element of surprise.
15573/Angus/he’s gonna hear us coming a mile away.
15574/Bea/we sure we want to do this?
15575/Gregg/yeah mae, you sure?
15576/Mae/guys, I don’t know if you understand...
15577/Mae/*cough*
15578/Mae/He's in my head.
15579/Mae/I can't function like this.
15580/Mae/everything is dying or dead already.
15581/Mae/I... I don't know what's gonna happen down there...
15582/Bea/ok then
15583/Bea/we’ll come out of this together
15584/Gregg/alright then.

15588/Bea/generations, even.
15589/Gregg/are you our tour guide now?
15590/Bea/we have Possum Springs tourism pamphlets at the shop
15591/Bea/and i get bored.
15592/Mae/*THIS* is in the brochure?
15593/Bea/well this isn’t dangerous or anything
15594/Mae/ha ha.
15595/Mae/Nothing to be scared of down there. Just a party.
15596/Bea/e_ĝoja
15597/Bea/heh heh.

15599/Bea/e_neûtrala_1
15600/Gregg/geez. Spooky.
15601/Mae/I don’t think we get to complain about spooky
15602/Mae/we left our precious robot boy out in the woods. That’s spooky.
15603/Gregg/e_ĝoja
15604/Gregg/nah dude. We created a legend.
15605/Bea/what are you two even talking about?

15740/Gregg/Mine river. We’re in a mine.
15741/Angus/right.
15742/Angus/hm.
15743/Gregg/i can see the bottom.
15744/Mae/i don't think we're gonna die in the one foot of water.
15745/Angus/right.
15746/Mae/I know what you are now
15747/Mae/I think I knew before
15748/Mae/but
15749/Mae/you know
15750/Mae/after I sent that kid to the hospital
15751/Mae/years ago
15752/Mae/they said I had an anger problem
15753/Mae/but that’s not true.
15754/Mae/I was angry because of something else.
15755/Mae/something I’d lost
15756/Mae/trying so hard since not to be angry
15757/Mae/got me all defenseless
15758/Mae/and i lost more, and more, and more...
15759/Mae/that's not getting better
15760/Mae/i want to be angry
15761/Mae/when I ran home, from college,
15762/Mae/on the bus I had this dream
15763/Mae/or maybe I saw it out the window
15764/Mae/last leaf on the tree
15765/Mae/finally blown off
15766/Mae/i'm so scared
15767/Mae/all the time
15768/Mae/and the fear *hurts*
15769/Mae/feeling like everything is over
15770/Mae/was over long before i got here
15771/Mae/so long, hiding
15772/Mae/or trying to outrun this.
15773/Mae/i get it.
15774/Mae/this won’t stop
15775/Mae/until i die
15776/Mae/but when i die
15777/Mae/i want it to hurt
15778/Mae/when my friends leave
15779/Mae/when i have to let go
15780/Mae/when this entire town is wiped off the map
15781/Mae/i want it to hurt. Bad.
15782/Mae/i want to lose
15783/Mae/i want to get beaten up
15784/Mae/i want to hold on
15785/Mae/until I’m thrown off
15786/Mae/and everything ends
15787/Mae/and you know what?
15788/Mae/until that happens
15789/Mae/i want to hope again
15790/Mae/and i want it to hurt.
15791/Mae/because that means it meant something
15792/Mae/it means i am... something, at least
15793/Mae/heh heh ha haheheh heh
15794/Mae/pretty amazing to be something, at least
15795/Ibon/1837582

15797/Ibon/3487234
15798/Mae/oh shut up already
15799/Mae/i know this won’t save me in the end
15800/Mae/but I don’t need it to save me forever
15801/Mae/i just need it to save me now
15802/Mae/so if you’re gonna kill me right here
15803/Mae/then do it
15804/Mae/if not,

16338/Mae/she like mummified a dude

16342/Mae/woohoo.
16343/Bea/you know

16345/Bea/if you weren't along for the ride
16346/Not Stated/along for the ride?!
16347/Mae/i believe i worked pretty hard down there.
16348/Mae/i should get a cut of the bill.

16355/Bea/channel that aggression you always have
16356/Bea/into something useful.

16363/Mae/isn't that what you do for mummies?
16364/Bea/i dunno, mae.
16365/Mae/do you think you'd have the stomach for it?
16366/Bea/nope.

16424/Mae/but they mostly leave you alone
16425/Mae/except when they're delivering food to you...
16426/Mae/that doesn't mean you can hide in your room
16427/Mae/and wait for that to happen.
16428/Mae/That's how hermits are made, Mae.
16429/Mae/And they die alone in the middle of winter.
16430/Mae/Waiting for pizza from friends they don't want to see.

16726/Mae/Here sir, I found your arm.

16747/Mom/Did you talk to him?
16748/Not Stated/I don't really remember.
16749/Mom/oh honey.
16750/Mae/it's fine.
16751/Mae/not... going to become a regular occurrence.
16752/Mom/ok well that's good
16753/Mae/e_krinĝega
16754/Mae/Anyway.
16755/Not Stated/Kind of. Sort of. I dunno.
16756/Mom/Well, he's a jerk, hon.
16757/Mae/No, he's not. Or he wasn't.
16758/Mae/I dunno.
16759/Mae/Anyway.
16760/Mom/Looks like most of the repair workers have cleared out of Towne Centre.
16761/Mae/FINALLY. e_mira e_ĝoja
16762/Mom/Yeah, they're all done with the churchill steps
16763/Mom/...and the powerlines...
16764/Mae/Great!
16765/Mom/Hon, I do *NOT* want you up on those things.
16766/Mae/e_krinĝega e_neûtrala_1
16767/Mae/Mom, I'm 20.
16768/Mom/Uh huh. Which means you go to jail for it.
16769/Not Stated/No one is going to jail for running around on the powerlines.
16770/Mom/It happens.
16771/Mae/Yeah, if the cops have literally nothing else to do.
16772/Mom/...
16773/Mae/Ok good point.
16774/Mae/e_ĝoja
16775/Mae/Aunt Molly would be so delighted to arrest me.
16776/Mom/Heh heh. She might just.
16777/Not Stated/Pssh. They'd never catch me.
16778/Mom/Your Aunt Molly catches you up there
16779/Mom/there's no telling what she'll do.
16780/Mae/Did I tell you I saw her yesterday out front?
16781/Mom/Really?
16782/Mae/Yeah she was being all weird and cryptic.
16783/Mae/I dunno. Everything's fuzzy today.
16784/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
16785/Mom/And anyway it's dangerous.
16786/Mom/You remember Susie Kushner?
16787/Mae/Gee mom I sure don't.
16788/Mae/I've definitely never heard this story 1000 times.
16789/Mom/Fried, honey. The paper used the word FRIED.
16790/Mom/Now she can't use adjectives.
16791/Mom/She lost an entire part of speech!
16792/Mae/Gee mom that's terrible.
16793/Mom/See that's the exact kind of sentence Susie can't formulate.
16794/Mae/...
16795/Mom/So what are you up to today?
16796/Mae/I dunno. Gonna go see what Gregg and Bea are up to.
16797/Mom/You all gonna do something together?
16798/Mae/I dunno. I don't think they hang out much
16799/Mae/past messing around with our old band equipment.
16800/Mom/Well, there are only so many hours and so many days in our lives.
16801/Mae/Is there some bug going around that makes people talk like fortune cookies?
16802/Mom/Friendships are like trees.
16803/Mae/Uh huh
16804/Mom/You have to water them so they grow.
16805/Mom/And we each have only so much water.
16806/Mae/Have you ever watered a tree?
16807/Mom/No, god does that.
16808/Mae/ok, I'm out.
16809/Mom/See you later, sweetie!
16810/Mae/e_mira e_neûtrala_1
16811/Mae/Whatcha readin'?

16813/Mom/living in a barrel, eating raw fish, crabs,
16814/Mom/octopus, squid, lobster, gulls, albatross,
16815/Not Stated/I get it.
16816/Not Stated/wow!
16817/Mom/sharks, dolphins, sea cucumbers,
16818/Mom/seaweed, sand, rocks,

16821/Not Stated/wow!
16822/Mom/ropes, sails, one of the boats, the rigging,
16823/Mom/sailor shoes, sailor hats, sailor pants

16829/Mom/...several dugongs and a manatee.
16830/Mom/Which are different, you know.
16831/Mae/I did know that.
16832/Mom/and that's a list of everything he ate.
16833/Mae/How do you eat fishing line?
16834/Mom/The crews thought the boat was haunted!
16835/Mom/But nope. Just the Barrel Boy.
16836/Mae/What's the book called?
16837/Mom/Barrel Boy.
16838/Mae/Oddly enough I now want fish sticks.
16839/Mom/I know right? I'll have your father bring some home.

16950/Mom/all doors are locked sometimes.
16951/Mae/not like
16952/Mae/saloon doors
16953/Mae/cowboys just walkin' in and out

16974/Mom/but some folks always find fault.
16975/Mom/either way she's got a big heart
16976/Mom/and that's what counts.

16978/Mom/hearts are like big stretchy bags
16979/Mae/ew

17409/Mae/I didn't really mean it.
17410/Mom/Well, whether you meant it or not
17411/Mom/that isn't how we should communicate.
17412/Mom/i don't want us to stop talking.
17413/Mom/i just... don't want a repeat of a few years ago.
17414/Mae/...
17415/Mae/I'm really sorry, mom.
17416/Mae/about all of it.
17417/Mom/hey mae... you ok?

17439/Mom/ok. Well that’s good.
17440/Mae/i’m gonna get going.
17441/Mom/ok! Have a nice day, sweetie!
17442/Mae/So what are you stressed about?
17443/Mom/Well, I guess you're a grown up now.
17444/Mae/e_krinĝega
17445/Mae/just spill it, mom.
17446/Mom/After your incident a few years back
17447/Mae/e_mira
17448/Mom/as you know, we went into some debt smoothing that over.
17449/Mae/geez. I'm still so sorry about that.
17450/Mom/it's in the past. let's not go back over it.
17451/Mae/ok
17452/Mom/when it came time to get you off to school
17453/Mom/we took advantage of a kinda of mortgage
17454/Mom/to make sure you were taken care of.
17455/Mae/e_mira_maldekstrokule
17456/Mae/ooooooook?
17457/Mom/well turns out it wasn't a very good deal
17458/Mom/and... i just feel so stupid...
17459/Mom/they like to offer these mortgages to people
17460/Mom/who maybe don't have a lot of money
17461/Mom/and aren't used to getting offers like this.
17462/Mae/e_malĝojeta
17463/Mae/why?
17464/Mom/because the bank took advantage of us.
17465/Mom/and now they own the house, and we owe them more than it's worth.
17466/Mae/what does that mean?
17467/Mom/means we're not sure how long into the future we'll have the house.
17468/Mae/e_mirega e_neûtrala_1
17469/Mae/holy crap we're in trouble, huh? And I'm a huge jerk?
17470/Mae/e_mira e_neûtrala_1
17471/Mom/it's ok, sweetie. don't worry.
17472/Mae/what are you stressed about?
17473/Mom/just budget. And bills. And stuff.
17474/Mae/oh.
17475/Mom/don't worry about it.
17476/Mae/ok!
17477/Mae/whatcha reading?
17478/Mom/it’s a book of unsolvable murders.
17479/Mae/did they all happen?
17480/Mom/oh i don’t know. Maybe. Sure.
17481/Mom/wanna hear a real teaser?
17482/Not Stated/sure!
17483/Mom/alright there’s a man lying dead in a kitchen
17484/Mom/with a bullet wound in his head
17485/Mom/there’s a man there with him.
17486/Mom/he’s got some blood on his right hand
17487/Mom/but no gun.
17488/Mae/huh.
17489/Mom/last thing- the dead guy has a scar on the back of his head.
17490/Mae/do you know the answer?
17491/Mom/well i don’t know if there’s *one* answer.
17492/Mom/it’s supposed to get ya thinkin’
17493/Not Stated/about murder?
17494/Mom/can’t solve a murder without one!
17495/Not Stated/you should have been a detective
17496/Mom/yeah.
17497/Mom/i woulda loved that.
17498/Mae/ok so i have a question.
17499/Mae/e_krinĝa
17500/Not Stated/what kind of scar does the dead guy have?
17501/Mom/“a straight line, a few inches across, hidden under the hair”
17502/Mae/hmmm.
17503/Not Stated/who’s the other guy in the room?
17504/Mom/“the suspect is clearly upper middle class”
17505/Mae/that’s not super helpful.
17506/Mom/maybe he like ski tripped him to death somehow.
17507/Mae/yeah he whacked him in the jacuzzi in his backyard.
17508/Not Stated/what else is in the room?
17509/Mom/normal stuff. Refrigerator, microwave, silverware.
17510/Mae/knives?
17511/Mom/no knife wounds though.
17512/Mae/oh right.
17513/Mae/e_mira
17514/Mae/ok i think i got it!
17515/Mom/wow! Whatcha got???
17516/Mae/the guy in the room is a surgeon.
17517/Mae/he implanted a magnet in the dead guy’s skull
17518/Mae/that’s why he has that scar.
17519/Mae/then the suspect used a super magnet or something
17520/Mae/on the dead guy’s forehead
17521/Mae/which pulled the magnet out through the dude’s head.
17522/Mom/ha ha! That’s why he has blood on one hand!
17523/Mae/yup. And i bet the murder weapons are stuck to the fridge
17524/Mae/holding up a pic of Aunt Dottie.
17525/Mom/oh bravo, sweetie!
17526/Mae/e_ĝoja
17527/Mae/thank you, thank you.
17528/Mom/we’d make quite a pair of investigators.
17529/Mae/could open a detective agency in town.
17530/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
17531/Mae/could use one right now probably.
17532/Mom/always work for crimesolvers!
17533/Mae/alright, i’m gonna get going.
17534/Mom/love you, daughter detective!
17535/Mae/you too, inspector mom!

17597/Mom/No, we as in "my friends and I when we were your age."
17598/Mae/Oh ok. I'm not used to you using any other we's.

17606/Mom/walking here...
17607/Mom/and the woman's daughter is in front of her

17609/Mae/What happened?
17610/Mom/Turns out there was a sinkhole that opened up
17611/Mom/when a pillar collapsed in the mines in the hill.
17612/Mae/Geez.
17613/Mom/Yep. No one could see it because of the grass.
17614/Mom/Her name was Jenny. This is Jenny's Field.
17615/Mom/They never found her.
17616/Mom/Just.
17617/Mom/*wwssssp!*

17623/Mom/Used to be a lot more trees around up here.
17624/Mom/They got cut down when they put in the towers.
17625/Mae/I don't remember that.
17626/Mom/You know, all kinds of things happened before you were born.
17627/Mae/WHAT?!?!
17628/Mom/Some minor parts of history took place, yes.
17629/Mae/AAAAGH!!

17631/Mae/I thought it was a... sinkhole thing...
17632/Mom/Hm. How about that.

17634/Mae/Ok... what is that?
17635/Mom/For some reason before Unified pulled out
17636/Mom/they brought this old lime furnace up on the mountain.
17637/Mae/Why?
17638/Mom/Who knows. Unified did a lot of things.
17639/Mae/Looks like it's been here forever.
17640/Mom/It's just sunk into the ground a lot.
17641/Mae/Like Jenny!
17642/Mom/But slower.
17643/Mom/We used to climb up there.
17644/Mae/Wanna try?
17645/Mom/Ha ha ha. Oh sweetie.
17646/Mom/I had you and also a lot of birthdays and donuts since then.
17647/Mom/And not much climbing.
17648/Mae/So... uh...
17649/Mae/Good thing this chimney is sealed up here!
17650/Mom/Ha ha ha. Yes, good thing.
17651/Mom/What can you see up there?
17652/Mom/It's been a while.
17653/Mae/Uh...
17654/Not Stated/Possum Springs and most of the valley!
17655/Mom/What does it look like?
17656/Not Stated/A quilt?
17657/Mom/Well, it's a cozy valley.
17658/Not Stated/Like someone dumped out some blocks?
17659/Mom/Ha ha. Sounds about right.
17660/Not Stated/The highway!
17661/Mom/What does it look like?
17662/Not Stated/A river? But like made of concrete? With cars?
17663/Mom/Always rolling by, the river.
17664/Mom/Oh, that river. It's big.
17665/Mae/Are you... singing?
17666/Mom/Yeah, it's from a musical?
17667/Mom/Maybe?
17668/Mae/e_ĝoja e_brakoj_supren_gaje
17669/Mae/IT IS NOOOOOOOOW!!!!
17670/Mom/Very nice.
17671/Not Stated/A snake? But like made of concrete? With cars?
17672/Mom/Heh heh. An eel maybe?
17673/Mae/Oh my god yes. A massive eel.
17674/Mom/Eels, honey.
17675/Mae/Eels, mom.
17676/Mae/What happened to the eel kid, by the way?
17677/Mom/Someone finally noticed him down there
17678/Mom/and emergency rescue pulled him out of the well.
17679/Mom/And years later he wrote a book about it
17680/Mom/and got rich!
17681/Mae/Did the eels get a cut of it?
17682/Mom/I don't think so.
17683/Mae/That's a crime.
17684/Mom/Won't anyone think of the poor eels?
17685/Mom/Big snake.
17686/Mae/Big snake.
17687/Mom/I got bit by a snake once up here, actually!
17688/Mae/I haven't heard this story.
17689/Mom/Yeah it was a copperhead. Jumped out from under a log.
17690/Mom/My boyfriend at the time, Charlie, he was such a sweetie
17691/Mom/tried to suck the snake poison from the bite on my leg.
17692/Mae/Wow. That's a good boyfriend.
17693/Mom/His mouth went numb and he suffered some tissue damage.
17694/Mom/And I still had to go to the hospital.
17695/Mae/Oh wow.
17696/Mom/Don't suck poison from snakebites, sweetie.
17697/Mae/Right.
17698/Mom/It doesn't work.
17699/Mae/Noted.
17700/Mae/e_neûtrala_2 e_neûtrala_1
17701/Mom/I remember I couldn't tell if being up there
17702/Mom/made everything feel bigger or smaller.
17703/Mom/It's a weird feeling.
17704/Mae/Yeah. I know that one.
17705/Mom/I used to have a dream when I was your age.
17706/Mom/Where I was in the big parking lot out by the tracks
17707/Mom/and I'd start running, but there was always more parking lot.
17708/Mae/Hm.
17709/Mom/What do you think it meant?
17710/Mae/I don't know. Feels weird to tell you what your dreams mean.
17711/Mom/Why?
17712/Mae/You're my mom.
17713/Mom/...
17714/Mom/Fair.
17715/Mae/Why did we come up here today?
17716/Mom/Well I was hoping you'd fall into a sinkhole, obviously.
17717/Mae/That didn't work out.
17718/Mom/Drat.
17719/Mom/Guess I'll just have to keep you.
17720/Mae/I couldn't see what your expression was when you said that.
17721/Mom/Do you need to?
17722/Mae/e_ĝoja
17723/Mae/No.
17724/Mom/Well, see you at home!
17725/Mae/e_malĝoja
17726/Mae/HEY!
17727/Bea/Well this should be good.
17728/Mae/I wonder what kind of-
17729/Mae/e_brakoj_supren_gaje e_malĝoja
17730/Mae/OH COME ON!
17731/Mae/There's no one working the counter!
17732/Bea/Oh wow.
17733/Mae/e_brako_surtalie
17734/Mae/HELLO?! ANYONE HERE?!
17735/Mae/Geez.
17736/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
17737/Bea/This is bleak.
17738/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
17739/Bea/This is like something out of a failed state or something.
17740/Mae/What's that?
17741/Bea/When you make a country and it doesn't work out.
17742/Mae/So... like this country?
17743/Mae/e_ĝoja e_krinĝega
17744/Bea/AAAAAYYYYYY.
17745/Mae/e_brako_surtalie

17748/Mae/Oh hey it's that band.
17749/Bea/What band?
17750/Mae/You knooooow...
17751/Mae/you remember this song
17752/Mae/had that video that people posted like a zillion times
17753/Bea/I have literally no idea what you're talking about.
17754/Mae/It had that weird horse in it.
17755/Mae/
17756/Bea/Ok yeah I remember. Had a weird horse in it.
17757/Mae/Oh god yeah that horse was all
17758/Mae/
17759/Bea/I remember.
17760/Mae/
17761/Bea/Yep. We have officially remembered that video.
17762/Mae/We did it!
17763/Mae/Looking at this by myself.
17764/Bea/Geeeeeeez.
17765/Bea/Ruins.
17766/Mae/Let's see what they've got.
17767/Not Stated/Honky Tonk Armaggeddon.
17768/Bea/Whoa. I'd actually listen to that.
17769/Bea/Just to see what the hell it even means.
17770/Mae/Cover's got a pickup truck exactly like my uncle's
17771/Mae/but this one is on fire and flying at a dragon's face.
17772/Bea/Upgrade.
17773/Not Stated/Clubbagurl: Rollin' Hard On That Eeee At This Rave Remixes
17774/Bea/Geez. That's cute.
17775/Mae/What does that mean?
17776/Bea/Someone's very excited to be out on a school night.
17777/Mae/Is it drugs?
17778/Bea/It is drugs.
17779/Mae/Looking at this without bea.
17780/Bea/Ok, we need to go.
17781/Bea/I am getting a contact depressive state from being in here.
17782/Mae/Geez. Yeah.
17783/Mae/Even the giant glowing scribble is depressing.
17784/Bea/Time moved on and left the glowing scribble behind.
17785/Mae/Ok yeah we're leaving.
17786/Bea/Yeah Bill. Write it up as on the clock.
17787/Bill/She’s not gonna like that.
17788/Bea/I don’t care if she doesn’t like it.
17789/Bea/It was her fault. Plain and simple.
17790/Bea/That is time extra. We charge for that.
17791/Bill/Alright then!
17792/Not Stated/Hey, Bea!
17793/Not Stated/What was that all about?
17794/Bea/Ugh. Don’t even ask.
17795/Bea/Mrs. Miranda has locked one of our guys in her basement twice.
17796/Mae/Why?
17797/Bea/Because she’s old and she forgets.
17798/Bea/Maybe if she gets a bill for it she’ll remember next time.
17799/Bea/Hi.
17800/Mae/How’s work?
17801/Bea/Stressful. End of the month coming up.
17802/Bea/And I have to start ordering in winter stuff.
17803/Bea/Which means I have to bribe one or hopefully two of the guys
17804/Bea/To unload the trucks.
17805/Bea/Because I am not carrying in a truckful of rock salt by myself.
17806/Mae/Huh.
17807/Bea/What do you want?
17808/Mae/Well, Gregg asked me to ask you if you would drive us to the party tonight?
17809/Mae/You know, the one up in the state park?
17810/Bea/Thanks for clarifying.
17811/Bea/Otherwise I might have been confused
17812/Bea/As to which of the dozens of parties
17813/Bea/going down on any given night in Possum Springs
17814/Bea/you were referring to.
17815/Mae/...are you being sarcastic? e_krinĝa
17816/Bea/I’ll drive.
17817/Mae/e_mira e_ĝoja Great! Thanks!
17818/Bea/We’ll be by your house at 8:30.
17819/Bea/Be ready or we’ll go without you.
17820/Mae/Ok! e_neûtrala_1
17821/Bea/Don't get lost on your way home.
17822/Mae/I know where I live.
17823/Bea/No seriously. Go home and get ready.
17824/Mae/Alright, alright! Geez.
17825/Bea/Hey Mae.
17826/Mae/How's the Pickaxe?
17827/Bea/trying to kill me

17830/Mae/what's so stressful?
17831/Bea/well, on top of everything else
17832/Bea/we're hosting that stupid harfest play tomorrow.
17833/Mae/oh woooooooooooooooow.
17834/Bea/yeah. i'm never offering to do this again.
17835/Mae/what are you up to tonight?
17836/Bea/uh. nothing.
17837/Bea/i'm like super tired.
17838/Bea/because everything about my life is exhausting
17839/Bea/and i'm doing the work of like 3 employees, plus a store owner
17840/Bea/even though I'm one employee, and i do not own this store.
17841/Mae/oh weird. I thought for some reason you owned this place now.
17842/Bea/you'd think.
17843/Bea/but also no. i'd rather die.
17844/Bea/literally make me a coffin
17845/Bea/using materials and tools from this store
17846/Bea/and bury me anywhere else.
17847/Mae/geez. that got intense.
17848/Bea/aaaaaaaaaaaaagh.
17849/Bea/anyway. i'm doing nothing tonight.
17850/Mae/i can do nothing too!
17851/Bea/...
17852/Bea/fine.
17853/Bea/So are we doing this?
17854/Not Stated/Not sure! Got a couple other stops to make.
17855/Bea/OK.

17864/Mae/Sure!
17865/Bea/Ready to go?
17866/Germ/you got a lot of hammers!
17867/Germ/holy shit there's so many kinds of nails!
17868/Mae/Alright then.
17869/Bea/He's like something out of a children's book
17870/Bea/about whatever the hell he is.
17871/Mae/Hey Bea.
17872/Bea/Yyyyo.
17873/Mae/Sorry about last night.
17874/Mae/I get woozy on cold medicine.
17875/Mae/So I don't really know what I expected to happen.
17876/Bea/Sorry for what I said.
17877/Mae/You know, I don't really remember it much.
17878/Mae/So whatevs.
17879/Bea/Hooray for alcohol.
17880/Mae/New town motto.
17881/Mae/Band practice later?
17882/Bea/Ha ha. Yep.
17883/Mae/I'm amazed it's still a thing.
17884/Mae/We were barely even a band in highschool.
17885/Bea/Eh. It's fun. Get to hang out with Angus.
17886/Mae/How did you even end up doing it?
17887/Bea/When Casey left town, Angus told me that Gregg was really sad.
17888/Bea/So I volunteered to be the new drummer.
17889/Mae/Well, "drummer."
17890/Mae/It's a laptop, Bea.
17891/Bea/It sure is, Mae. It sure is.

17897/Bea/came in early this year.
17898/Bea/and like a *crapload* of snow shovels...
17899/Bea/usually the distro place doesn't goof up like this.
17900/Mae/maybe it's run by weather wizards?
17901/Bea/yeah that's not a bad theory.
17902/Bea/so what's up?
17903/Mae/wanna hang out tonight????
17904/Bea/uh. i'm working.
17905/Bea/if you wanna like

17925/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
17926/Mae/When’s this thing supposed to start?
17927/Bea/Uh... 10 minutes... I think?
17928/Mae/You think?
17929/Bea/Ugh this is a nightmare.
17930/Bea/Why did I ever agree to do this?
17931/Bea/Chamber of Commerce owes me big for this.
17932/Mae/Geez. I hear ya.
17933/Bea/...
17934/Bea/...
17935/Mae/What?
17936/Bea/ok so here's the thing- you won't have many lines...
17937/Mae/What?!
17938/Bea/I've had like 3 no-shows!
17939/Mae/Why?
17940/Bea/BECAUSE THIS WHOLE THING IS STUPID AND NOBODY CARES ABOUT IT!!!
17941/Mae/Bea,
17942/Bea/Please? It's a fun part!
17943/Mae/Bea.
17944/Bea/Yeah?
17945/Mae/I will totally save your ass.
17946/Mae/I might have this memorized from when I was a kid.
17947/Bea/Probably not. They rewrote it like 6 times in the past 2 years
17948/Bea/to be spookier
17949/Bea/so it's like 20% actual history now
17950/Bea/and like 80% spooks.
17951/Not Stated/So it's like fake history now?
17952/Bea/It's like... the bad remake
17953/Bea/that doesn't respect the source material.
17954/Not Stated/Ok weird.
17955/Bea/it starts off normal but gets... anyway.
17956/Bea/You got like 5 minutes to look at your lines.
17957/Mae/Pssh. I can wing it.
17958/Bea/Mae, please don't wing it.
17959/Mae/ok.
17960/Bea/Oh! I didn't see ye there!
17961/Bea/Be ye ghosts?
17962/Bea/Are ye here to hear
17963/Bea/the tale of how Possum Springs came to be?
17964/Bea/Through the mists of time I see
17965/Bea/Weary fur trappers, from 1793.
17966/Dan/Brother John!
17967/Bill/Yes, Brother Steven!
17968/Dan/From this vantage point I do spy a deep hollow
17969/Dan/and within, a great dead tree
17970/Dan/and besides with... uh, which, a spring!
17971/Bill/Blessed are we, brother steven,
17972/Bill/for truly my throat is parched
17973/Bill/from these long and arduous travels
17974/Bill/and carrying these 300 beaver pelts.
17975/Dan/Let us make haste, oh excellent brother!
17976/Not Stated/Ho! Travelers! Spare a crust of bread for a needy woman?
17977/Not Stated/Ho! Travelers! Help an extremely old woman?
17978/Mae/uh. please help.
17979/Bea/Wha-?
17980/Not Stated/Oh no, I am made of cobwebs from being so old!
17981/Bea/Uh. The travelers had no idea what this meant.
17982/Not Stated/I must have food to restore my youthful form, for once I was a comely lass.
17983/Bea/...
17984/Bill/Haggard witch!
17985/Dan/Horrible to look upon!
17986/Mae/Cruel young men,
17987/Mae/Ye did not even offer one of thy 300 fine beaver pelts,
17988/Mae/to warm my ancient bones!
17989/Not Stated/I shall curse ye, and thee,
17990/Mae/and this very night ye shall perish.
17991/Dan/I am fearful!
17992/Bill/Steady, Brother Steven
17993/Bill/I did not venture out into these hills
17994/Bill/to joust words with a hell-hag!
17995/Not Stated/Thou art a rude and naughty boy,
17996/Bill/...
17997/Mae/Thy naughtiness must be met with punishment!
17998/Dan/I... art... uncomfortable!
17999/Bea/Um.
18000/Not Stated/Thy punishment is a curse,
18001/Mae/that shall take ye and thee
18002/Mae/even this very night!
18003/Bea/*whew*
18004/Not Stated/Thy punishment is a task, terrible!
18005/Bea/wha-
18006/Mae/Thou shall return to thy town...
18007/Bill/um
18008/Mae/Dig up the oldest grave in the churchyard...
18009/Dan/uh
18010/Mae/...and kiss them!
18011/Bill/what?
18012/Bea/But the witch was only joking around
18013/Bea/to frighten the travelers!
18014/Bea/and instead she cursed them to die that very night!
18015/Mae/YEE HEE HEE HEEEEEE!
18016/Mae/I was born among these trees
18017/Mae/'neath a harvest moon
18018/Mae/and ye shall die under that moon!
18019/Dan/Brother John, I am frightened!
18020/Bill/Faith, Brother Steven!
18021/Bill/Art thou so easily shaken by the ramblings of an old crone?
18022/Bill/come, help me carry these 300 beaver pelts.
18023/Bea/...but little did anyone know
18024/Bea/that the witch did not curse...
18025/Bea/IN VAIN.
18026/Dan/Help! Help!
18027/Dan/Who will help a poor traveler?!
18028/Gregg/Uh... um
18029/Gregg/uh, by the moon and stars above us, sir
18030/Gregg/i beseech thee, what is thy trouble?
18031/Mae/you’re in this?
18032/Gregg/yup
18033/Dan/AAAGGGH!! WIIIITCH!!!
18034/Mae/yup
18035/Dan/I swear thee, friend, that this very day
18036/Dan/this horrifying crone
18037/Dan/did curse my brother and I to die!
18038/Gregg/'Zwounds!
18039/Dan/We camped by this very spring beneath the dead tree
18040/Dan/and even now his body lieth upon the earth,
18041/Dan/lifeless as a pile of 300 beaver pelts!
18042/Gregg/Oh! It chilleth the heart!!!
18043/Mae/EE HEE HEE HEEEEEEE!!!
18044/Not Stated/I did curse this spring!
18045/Mae/that any man who drinketh from it shall perish!
18046/Dan/AAAGH! I AM SLAIN!
18047/Dan/I join thee now, brother steven!!!
18048/Not Stated/A curse upon rude young men!
18049/Gregg/that's not-
18050/Dan/um
18051/Bea/...
18052/Dan/She has cursed the spring, and now I shall die!!!
18053/Mae/wow
18054/Gregg/I am also undone, for I have dranketh of the water!
18055/Mae/Don’t leave me here Gregg.
18056/Gregg/Byeeeeeeeeee.
18057/Bea/and yet, even there
18058/Bea/the curse's lust for blood...
18059/Bea/...WOULD NOT BE SATED!!!
18060/Bea/Gaze upon them! Gaze upon these spirits!
18061/Bill/Brother, we are now ghosts!
18062/Bill/aah! i am tormented by the accusing glare
18063/Bill/of 300 ghostly beavers!
18064/Dan/It would seem that all who die here
18065/Dan/are cursed to never leave!
18066/Bill/Doth that witch know what she hath done?
18067/Mae/uhh... um...
18068/Mae/...crap...
18069/Bea/"Foooooor,
18070/Not Stated/For what is a ghost,
18071/Mae/but that which haunts the empty space
18072/Mae/that was once full?
18073/Janitor/And once haunted, can a place be unhaunted?
18074/Not Stated/For each man is determined on his path
18075/Mae/and each path leads only to his end.
18076/Bea/ok...?

18273/Mae/Someone in a big old coat with someone over their back.
18274/Molly/Uh huh.
18275/Molly/And you chased them down here?
18276/Mae/Yeah and I got to the fence and they were up in the woods.
18277/Molly/Alright. Thank you, Mae.
18278/Mae/Ugh. I knew you were just gonna brush this off.
18279/Molly/Mae, there's been no missing person reports.
18280/Molly/That *tends* to happen when a kid goes missing from something like Harfest.
18281/Molly/Hell, I got 6 calls about kids out too late.
18282/Molly/There would be a report.
18283/Mae/I'M REPORTING!! This! This right here! This is a report!
18284/Molly/Mae, there's no break in the fence.
18285/Mae/So?
18286/Molly/So unless someone could jump this thing...
18287/Molly/while carrying a teenager...
18288/Molly/who hasn't been reported as missing...
18289/Mae/...
18290/Molly/Any theories, Mae?
18291/Mae/...
18292/Not Stated/No.
18293/Not Stated/They could've gone around the fence!
18294/Molly/I dunno Mae,
18295/Molly/this fence goes out along the parking lots
18296/Molly/almost to the tracks.
18297/Molly/For you to be right behind them,
18298/Molly/and then to be miraculously on the other side of the fence?
18299/Mae/UUUUUUUUURGH.
18300/Molly/I was running around half the night
18301/Molly/getting after teenage bullshit
18302/Molly/and people scared of clotheslines and noises.
18303/Mae/I- you- y-you- aaaargh!!!
18304/Mae/Are you *TRYING* to kick off a horror movie?
18305/Mae/No one believes the girl who saw the ghost!
18306/Mae/Well, I have bad news for you-
18307/Mae/THE COP ALWAYS DIES.
18308/Molly/I'm sorry, we're talking about a “GHOST” now?
18309/Mae/It must've gone through the fence??
18310/Molly/Really, Mae?
18311/Mae/No! Yes! I don't know!
18312/Mae/I'm really tired.
18313/Molly/Yeah that's kinda what I thought.
18314/Mae/Will you at least check the woods?
18315/Molly/Mae, me and Dan McConnell were up there this morning
18316/Molly/because of what YOU said last night.
18317/Molly/From the fence up to the old mine.
18318/Molly/We found a couple teenagers on a gross mattress,
18319/Molly/we saw some worried-looking deer,
18320/Molly/and one deer hunter out too early.
18321/Mae/That can't be it.
18322/Molly/That is it.
18323/Mae/THE COP ALWAYS DIES!
18324/Mae/*pant pant*
18325/Mae/where the hell did he go?
18326/Mae/Shiiiit.
18327/Molly/Mae.
18328/Molly/Go home.
18329/Mae/There's a guy up there on the hill!
18330/Mae/he stole some kid?
18331/Mae/he looked like a ghost!
18332/Molly/a ghost, huh?
18333/Mae/Or something like that?
18334/Molly/Mae, you shouldn't be out here
18335/Molly/doing whatever it is you're doing.
18336/Mae/NO! NO ONE SHOULD BE OUT HERE!
18337/Mae/But there's this guy-
18338/Molly/I'll drive you home, Mae.
18339/Mae/NO!
18340/Molly/MAE! NOW.
18341/Mae/We're saying goodbye to each other after the well woods.
18342/Angus/Yes.
18343/Gregg/Yes.
18344/Bea/Yes.
18345/Mae/We're talking about walking to the woods.
18346/Bea/Talking and walking.
18347/Angus/Yes we are.
18348/Gregg/Indeed.
18349/Mae/how did he get over this thing?
18350/Mae/i can’t jump that. No way he could have.
18351/Mae/there’s no hole.
18352/Mae/how did he do it?
18353/Mae/i mean i guess he could really be a ghost
18354/Mae/i think he’s a ghost
18355/Mae/ugh.
18356/Mae/...what’s out there?
18357/Lori/you know what we don’t have around here?
18358/Mae/a taco place.
18359/Lori/serial killers.
18360/Mae/oh yeah. hm.
18361/Mae/i mean i'd vote for us getting a taco place first but
18362/Mae/yeah we never got around to getting our own serial killer
18363/Lori/you ever think about murdering someone?
18364/Lori/like ok so
18365/Lori/a few Longest Nights ago i went to Bright Harbor with my aunt and cousin
18366/Lori/and we went on the subway
18367/Lori/and like there's no railing down there above the tracks
18368/Lori/and i had this sudden urge to like shove someone off it?
18369/Lori/it was weird and i felt guilty about it for a long time
18370/Lori/but like i didn't actually do it so
18371/Lori/i mean is that normal?
18372/Mae/i think that's pretty normal
18373/Lori/i guess you actually *did* try to kill someone
18374/Not Stated/that was different
18375/Lori/how?
18376/Mae/that was like... not planned
18377/Not Stated/no i didn't
18378/Lori/a lot of people think so
18379/Mae/yeah well
18380/Mae/a lot of people are really stupid
18381/Mae/and i wasn't trying to kill him
18382/Mae/it was just a thing that happened
18383/Mae/so yeah
18384/Mae/it wasn't like my first step
18385/Mae/on the way to serial killer-dom
18386/Lori/sorry.
18387/Mae/it's cool.
18388/Lori/you know what I like?
18389/Mae/tacos
18390/Lori/pictures of the meteor that killed the dinosaurs
18391/Lori/where the dinosaurs are watching it in the sky
18392/Mae/oh yeah
18393/Mae/that’s like every single picture of that meteor
18394/Mae/weird
18395/Lori/wonder if they knew
18396/Lori/ok ok ok ok
18397/Lori/let’s see what we got!
18398/Lori/I come out here at night sometimes
18399/Lori/and fall asleep between the tracks
18400/Not Stated/That sounds dangerous
18401/Not Stated/why?
18402/Lori/I don’t know.
18403/Lori/I feel excited and I can sleep
18404/Lori/you ever have that
18405/Lori/where you’re so excited you go to sleep?
18406/Not Stated/Coffee makes me sleepy
18407/Lori/ha ha. Wuss.
18408/Mae/guilty.
18409/Not Stated/I have stress dreams if I’m too keyed up
18410/Lori/I don’t remember my dreams
18411/Lori/sometimes I fall asleep for like 5 minutes
18412/Lori/but sometimes it’s for like an hour
18413/Mae/that’s some risky business there
18414/Lori/I have weird thoughts
18415/Lori/like sometimes I want to go sleep in the woods
18416/Lori/or in the basement of an abandoned house during the day
18417/Lori/and only come out at night
18418/Lori/and be, like, a monster
18419/Lori/and, like, beautiful.
18420/Not Stated/I know the feeling
18421/Mae/I want to eat people sometimes
18422/Lori/Really???
18423/Mae/Pretty much as soon as I meet anyone
18424/Mae/I wonder what they taste like
18425/Lori/I feel like the world is full of bad people
18426/Lori/who would be good to eat
18427/Mae/Mmmmmmmhmm.
18428/Not Stated/Those are, like, really attainable dreams
18429/Lori/oh ha ha
18430/Lori/i’m not beautiful
18431/Mae/oh you’re fine
18432/Mae/no one your age likes how they look
18433/Lori/i’m objectively gross
18434/Mae/way less gross than I was
18435/Lori/do you think?
18436/Mae/guaranteed
18437/Lori/ok ok ok ok
18438/Lori/let’s see what we got
18439/Angus/Nice evening.
18440/Mae/Yeah, it’s alright.
18441/Angus/My mom used to take us up here to play frisbee.
18442/Mae/I got hit in the teeth with a frisbee once. full speed.
18443/Angus/geez.
18444/Mae/Casey and me were throwing things at each other's heads.
18445/Angus/oh.
18446/Mae/we stopped after the frisbee.
18447/Angus/POSTED -
18448/Angus/DO NOT FEED
18449/Angus/OR TOUCH
18450/Angus/THE WILDLIFE.
18451/Not Stated/well, that seems extreme
18452/Angus/I dunno.
18453/Angus/you can't go to the woods to like
18454/Angus/socialize
18455/Angus/with the woods.
18456/Mae/i guess.
18457/Not Stated/well, clearly
18458/Angus/there's some folks living in cabins up here
18459/Angus/you can... uh... feed and touch them if you want.
18460/Mae/...
18461/Mae/it's a weird, old place up here
18462/Angus/there's all kinda of weird stuff back up in the park
18463/Angus/old stuff just hanging out in the woods
18464/Angus/we'll hit my old scout camp on the way up i think
18465/Mae/busy woods
18466/Angus/ok, better get going before it gets dark.
18467/Angus/*puff puff*
18468/Mae/you alright?
18469/Angus/yeah, i got asthma is all.
18470/Angus/sorry you gotta wait for me.
18471/Not Stated/do you have an inhaler?
18472/Angus/yeah, but i save that for emergencies.
18473/Angus/being slow isn't an emergency.
18474/Not Stated/didn't you run cross country back in junior high?
18475/Angus/yeah but i never finished a race.
18476/Mae/why'd you keep doing it?
18477/Angus/i have no idea.
18478/Mae/what is this thing?
18479/Angus/this is like
18480/Angus/a lime kiln i think?
18481/Not Stated/limes?
18482/Not Stated/kiln?
18483/Angus/like a furnace.
18484/Mae/oh. furnace for what?
18485/Angus/limestone
18486/Angus/you like do something with it in there
18487/Angus/and it becomes this other thing.
18488/Mae/oh.
18489/Angus/limestone's weird because
18490/Angus/it's mostly made of skeletons of sea creatures
18491/Angus/from millions of years ago
18492/Angus/so like
18493/Angus/this was all underwater or something at one point.
18494/Not Stated/whoa
18495/Angus/i know, right?
18496/Not Stated/no way
18497/Angus/i mean, rocks don't lie
18498/Angus/like right where we're standing
18499/Angus/there were like ancient horrible sea monsters
18500/Mae/creepy. and awesome.
18501/Angus/thaaaaaaat's history!
18502/Angus/ok, I'm ready to go.
18503/Angus/*puff puff*
18504/Angus/Phew.
18505/Mae/Need to take a break?
18506/Angus/I'm okay, I'm okay.
18507/Mae/no prob.
18508/Angus/*huff huff*
18509/Mae/so if this place was underwater
18510/Not Stated/where'd the water go?
18511/Angus/i dunno. to the ocean i guess.
18512/Angus/and like the earth is always shifting
18513/Angus/so mountains get all pushed up
18514/Angus/where it used to be just flat ground.
18515/Not Stated/why aren't there like ancient shark bones up here?
18516/Angus/i dunno. there might be i guess.
18517/Angus/but not everything becomes a fossil
18518/Mae/why?
18519/Angus/i dunno. i'm not an expert on any of this.
18520/Angus/but there were definitely ancient sharks around here.
18521/Mae/weird because things are so boring nowadays
18522/Mae/to think like all that crazy stuff was going on here.
18523/Angus/there's always more weird stuff that happened
18524/Angus/to find out about later.
18525/Angus/ok, i'm ready to go.

19305/Pastor/i dreamed i was trapped in a wall
19306/Mae/geez
19307/Pastor/no, it was fine.
19308/Pastor/i knew the rescue crew was coming in a few hours
19309/Pastor/and it was cozy
19310/Pastor/so i could take a nap, guilt-free.
19311/Mae/you feel guilty about naps?
19312/Pastor/wish I didn't.
19313/Mae/How's that whole thing with Bruce going?
19314/Pastor/I'm hopeful and positive
19315/Mae/that sounds like what someone says
19316/Mae/when they're not.
19317/Pastor/ha ha

19319/Pastor/Howdy.

19322/Mae/a... date?
19323/Pastor/not the kind you mean.
19324/Pastor/honestly a big part of my job
19325/Pastor/is someone calling
19326/Pastor/me heading out
19327/Pastor/and them not showing up.
19328/Mae/you were meeting them at
19329/Mae/the statue of... saint...
19330/Pastor/Rubello.
19331/Mae/yeah. the firebreathing guy
19332/Mae/who like, ate people.
19333/Pastor/that's a bit of an oversimplification
19334/Mae/...
19335/Pastor/but yeah. basically.
19336/Mae/cool guy to have a statue of
19337/Mae/outside the church I mean.
19338/Pastor/well, i didn't put it here
19339/Pastor/but can't we learn something from Saint Rubello?
19340/Not Stated/breathe fire
19341/Not Stated/eat people
19342/Pastor/sure.
19343/Pastor/this statue is part of our "encourage criminal acts" outreach
19344/Mae/it's working!
19345/Mae/How's the situation?
19346/Pastor/the situation?
19347/Mae/with Bruce and stuff.
19348/Pastor/eh.
19349/Pastor/we wait and see.
19350/Pastor/and pray.
19351/Pastor/I'm gone today! This is an error!
19352/Mae/Bruce situation A3D2?
19353/Pastor/Eh.
19354/Pastor/Ugh. Stressful day.
19355/Pastor/some days you need grace more than others.
19356/Mae/Was this all about Bruce?
19357/Pastor/It was.
19358/Pastor/is.
19359/Pastor/whatever. It's out of our hands now.
19360/Pastor/but there are better hands than mine.
19361/Mae/hm.
19362/Pastor/Anyway, how are you Mae?
19363/Mae/Eh.
19364/Mae/Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh.
19365/Pastor/sounds serious.
19366/Mae/I guess.
19367/Pastor/Hey listen
19368/Pastor/You know
19369/Pastor/If you ever want to talk or have any questions
19370/Mae/about, like, god?
19371/Pastor/sure.
19372/Pastor/you can always talk to me.
19373/Pastor/it's kind of in my job description.
19374/Mae/ok.
19375/Mae/so like
19376/Mae/things have been rough lately
19377/Pastor/i can see that.
19378/Pastor/what seems to be the trouble?
19379/Mae/i think i met god
19380/Pastor/what?
19381/Not Stated/it was a dream
19382/Mae/but god talks to us that way, right?
19383/Pastor/sure.
19384/Not Stated/i don't think it was a dream
19385/Pastor/oh wow.
19386/Mae/that happens, right?
19387/Mae/or it like, happened.
19388/Pastor/sure.
19389/Pastor/can you tell me about it?
19390/Not Stated/i was in this desert
19391/Mae/as far as i could see
19392/Mae/where like
19393/Mae/all that was left of the world
19394/Mae/was bits of wood
19395/Mae/and sand
19396/Not Stated/it was like the shore
19397/Mae/of this giant black ocean
19398/Mae/i could see like
19399/Mae/forever into the sky
19400/Mae/and below it was just
19401/Mae/sand
19402/Mae/as far as i could see
19403/Mae/i was wandering through it but
19404/Mae/i was like, drawn to something
19405/Mae/and i came up over this...
19406/Mae/what do you call a hill made of sand?
19407/Pastor/A dune.
19408/Mae/yeah. A Dune.
19409/Mae/and there was god.
19410/Mae/just sitting there. up on another hill.
19411/Mae/or dune. whatever.
19412/Pastor/just hangin' out?
19413/Mae/yeah.
19414/Mae/seemed like they were *really* into just hanging out.
19415/Pastor/did they say anything?
19416/Mae/yeah
19417/Not Stated/they like, didn't care
19418/Pastor/they didn't care if you were there?
19419/Mae/no, i mean, they didn't care.
19420/Mae/in general.
19421/Not Stated/they were kind of a... jerk
19422/Mae/i mean, more of a straight up asshole.
19423/Mae/sorry. can i say that in a church?
19424/Pastor/ha ha.
19425/Pastor/i think the structure can handle the shock.
19426/Mae/they went on and on about how annoyed they were
19427/Mae/that people kept coming to them with questions
19428/Mae/and annoyed that anyone thought they were god to begin with
19429/Pastor/well, i don't think that was god then
19430/Mae/why?
19431/Pastor/if something tells you it isn't god
19432/Pastor/you should probably believe it.
19433/Mae/no, what i mean is that
19434/Mae/the thing we call god
19435/Mae/isn't god
19436/Mae/it's just a thing
19437/Mae/and it doesn't care
19438/Pastor/hm.
19439/Mae/they kept talking about
19440/Not Stated/how nothing matters
19441/Mae/like the universe is ending
19442/Mae/and everything is being forgotten.
19443/Not Stated/this giant hole
19444/Mae/in the center of everything.
19445/Mae/growing.
19446/Pastor/that sounds very lonely.
19447/Pastor/have you been feeling lonely lately?
19448/Not Stated/yes.
19449/Mae/i had this problem when i was in high school
19450/Mae/and i did something really bad.
19451/Mae/you probably heard about it.
19452/Pastor/your mom has mentioned it.
19453/Mae/yeah i figured.
19454/Mae/well, since then
19455/Not Stated/no.
19456/Mae/no, i mean i've got friends
19457/Mae/i've been with them every day since i got home.
19458/Mae/but... hm...
19459/Mae/there's this deep down loneliness
19460/Mae/been there for years
19461/Mae/since... well, just been a long time.
19462/Pastor/i've been there.
19463/Pastor/i mean i'm there all the time
19464/Pastor/i think that's where
19465/Pastor/if we open ourselves up
19466/Pastor/god can enter our lives most effectively
19467/Not Stated/i guess
19468/Pastor/sometimes that's the best you've got.
19469/Mae/yeah.
19470/Mae/...
19471/Pastor/i feel like that's maybe not a good enough answer for you
19472/Mae/is that a good enough answer for anyone?
19473/Not Stated/i don't think i believe in god anymore
19474/Pastor/if you want the truth
19475/Pastor/i think everyone doesn't believe in god
19476/Pastor/for at least a few minutes a day
19477/Mae/hm.
19478/Pastor/faith is a process
19479/Pastor/you have to keep getting up and choosing to go on
19480/Mae/do you really think there's a god?
19481/Mae/like, literally someone up there listening?
19482/Mae/is that something you completely believe?
19483/Pastor/hm.
19484/Pastor/i don't know.
19485/Mae/oh.
19486/Pastor/on my best days I think I do.
19487/Pastor/but there are times where I don't.
19488/Mae/but... but you stand up there every sunday
19489/Mae/and tell people you do!
19490/Mae/and even *YOU'RE* not sure?
19491/Mae/It's your *JOB* to believe.
19492/Pastor/well, I think it's more my job to serve others...
19493/Mae/but you're lying to people!
19494/Pastor/how?
19495/Mae/you stand up there and tell people to believe
19496/Mae/in something you don't 100% believe in yourself.
19497/Pastor/maybe you're right Mae
19498/Pastor/and maybe I should get up there every week
19499/Pastor/and give some sort of tally of how much I believed that week
19500/Pastor/but who would that help?
19501/Mae/but you're a pastor
19502/Mae/and you can't tell me whether or not god is up there.
19503/Mae/whether anyone is watching
19504/Mae/anyone who gives a shit.
19505/Pastor/no, but-
19506/Mae/e_malĝoja
19507/Mae/THEN WHAT IS THE POINT OF YOU?
19508/Pastor/...
19509/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
19510/Mae/...
19511/Mae/I have to go.
19512/Pastor/ok.
19513/Mae/so what's your story?
19514/Bruce/uh. got no story.
19515/Mae/like, where are you from?
19516/Bruce/north of here. northeast.
19517/Bruce/...
19518/Bruce/worked on the railroads
19519/Bruce/worked some mines
19520/Bruce/worked some construction.
19521/Mae/how'd you end up here?
19522/Bruce/string 'a bad luck
19523/Bruce/...
19524/Mae/don't have to talk about it.
19525/Bruce/i never turn down that offer.
19526/Bruce/Seen a fire through the trees last night.
19527/Bruce/past these woods here.
19528/Bruce/Weird noises.
19529/Bruce/I just kept to myself.
19530/Bruce/and they went away.
19531/Not Stated/That sounds spooky.
19532/Bruce/Been around a lotta places.
19533/Bruce/Ain't spooked by much.
19534/Bruce/But out past that water tower...
19535/Not Stated/Where?
19536/Bruce/right over there
19537/Bruce/past the water tower.
19538/Mae/oh ok.
19539/Mae/yeah that's a place where teens hang out.
19540/Bruce/let's hope that's all it was.
19541/Bruce/in my experience
19542/Bruce/strange fire and strange voices
19543/Bruce/ain't never been good.
19544/Mae/I wonder if they'll be back...?
19545/Bruce/Hope not.
19546/Mae/getting kinda cold, huh?
19547/Bruce/yeah, nip in the air at night.
19548/Mae/i like fall when it gets cold.
19549/Bruce/me too. real pretty out a'swell.
19550/Mae/i used to cry at fall trees when i was a kid.
19551/Bruce/why?
19552/Mae/because they were so pretty.
19553/Bruce/hm. i did that when my daughter was born.
19554/Mae/you have a daughter?
19555/Bruce/yep.
19556/Mae/where is she?
19557/Bruce/...
19558/Mae/sorry.
19559/Bruce/s'fine.
19560/Pastor/You warm enough at night?
19561/Bruce/Yeah, you know I get by.
19562/Pastor/Well, I'm working on something to help you out.
19563/Bruce/Aw, don't go to any trouble. I'm alright.
19564/Pastor/That's good.
19565/Bruce/Gonna get cold soon.
19566/Pastor/I can get you some blankets for now.
19567/Pastor/For some reason we have a *LOT* of blankets.
19568/Bruce/That'd sure be a blessing!
19569/Pastor/Well, we bless best with what we already have too much of anyway.
19570/Bruce/Heh heh.
19571/Pastor/And we got blankets!
19572/Bruce/Ha ha ha
19573/Pastor/
19574/Bruce/
19575/Council1/he's very nice.
19576/Pastor/yeah, and he can be like, the first!
19577/Pastor/a trial run.
19578/Council2/where would you put him?
19579/Pastor/oh in the basement,
19580/Pastor/or in the old library?
19581/Council3/with all the books?
19582/Pastor/he's not going to eat them.
19583/Council4/interesting proposal, Kate.
19584/Council1/yes, thank you for bringing this to us.
19585/Pastor/i look forward to us moving forward together on this.
19586/Council2/it will be brought up at the town council meeting.
19587/Pastor/oh!! that's wonderful!!
19588/Council1/alright, troops! move out!
19589/Bruce/I don't feel right about it.
19590/Pastor/I know, but sometimes the right thing doesn't feel right.
19591/Bruce/i just think... it's just wrong to take something
19592/Bruce/when folks don't want you to take it.
19593/Pastor/well...
19594/Pastor/i feel like god would see this differently.
19595/Pastor/i do at least.
19596/Bruce/hmmm
19597/Bruce/that's because you're a good person.
19598/Pastor/
19599/Bruce/
19600/Council2/...because there will be children here!
19601/Council3/and this is a historic church
19602/Pastor/that's half empty!
19603/Council3/that's your job to fix, not ours!
19604/Pastor/the population drain in this region
19605/Pastor/you have to know this place'll never be full again.
19606/Pastor/we have the space, and we have people who need space.
19607/Pastor/we have resources, and we have poverty!
19608/Pastor/and not in some far off place or some big city!
19609/Pastor/right here! right across the street!
19610/Council1/Katie, it's our number one job right now
19611/Council1/to bring businesses into town.
19612/Council1/businesses mean jobs, and jobs means people.
19613/Council1/we have to do what we can
19614/Council1/to get the attention of the market.
19615/Council1/and having a half-dead church stacked full of bums-
19616/Pastor/thanks for your time.
19617/Council1/We'll see you for the vote tomorrow night.

19638/Mae/this just makes me sad we don't have a pizza place anymore
19639/Pastor/gotta order it from out by the highway now.
19640/Pastor/tragic.
19641/Bruce/i had a dream i was a goose flying south
19642/Bruce/and i had to keep up with the other gooses
19643/Bruce/or i'd get lost.
19644/Mae/that's sad.

19659/Bruce/Can we just stand out here for a while?
19660/Pastor/It’s just the Clik Clak!
19661/Pastor/It ain’t some fancy place.
19662/Pastor/You’ll be more than welcome.
19663/Bruce/I know... I just...
19664/Pastor/Fine. We can stand here as long as you like.
19665/Pastor/Or until 7:30. I have a prayer group to run.

19668/Pastor/You’re Candy’s daughter!
19669/Mae/Yeah.

19672/Pastor/Have you met Bruce?
19673/Mae/Hey Bruce.
19674/Bruce/Hello.
19675/Pastor/Bruce has never been to the Clik Clak!
19676/Not Stated/How is that possible?
19677/Not Stated/You are in for a treat.
19678/Pastor/See Bruce?
19679/Mae/A greasy, greasy treat.
19680/Mae/and an angry waitress.
19681/Bruce/Sounds like my kinda place.
19682/Pastor/Bruce is new in town so he’s never had the pleasure
19683/Mae/You live around here?
19684/Bruce/um...
19685/Pastor/Bruce is our neighbor up at the church.
19686/Bruce/...I’m camped out across the street...
19687/Mae/oh.
19688/Bruce/in the woods.
19689/Pastor/But not for long! We’re working on fixing that before winter gets here.
19690/Pastor/gonna take some doing, but God’s a do-er.
19691/Bruce/...still thinks it’s a lot of trouble to go to...
19692/Pastor/Listen, nobody said loving your neighbor would be easy.
19693/Pastor/and you are our actual neighbor.
19694/Bruce/I appreciate it.
19695/Pastor/We all need a little help sometimes, Bruce.
19696/Pastor/No shame in hard times.
19697/Mae/Well, it was nice meeting you both!
19698/Pastor/Come up and see me at the church sometime!
19699/Mae/I will! I’ll be up to visit my mom anyway.

19701/Bruce/ok. Nice to meet you Mary
19702/Mae/Mae. Mae Borowski.
19703/Bruce/Bruce. Just Bruce.
19704/Pastor/Pastor. Pastor Kate.
19705/Mae/are you guys waiting for someone?
19706/Bruce/no
19707/Pastor/Bruce is a little gunshy
19708/Bruce/ain’t been in a restaurant in a while
19709/Pastor/Click Clack’s as good as any place to start!
19710/Bruce/...gotta get back on the horse sometime…
19711/Mae/You might actually order horse in there without knowing it.
19712/Pastor/Mae...
19713/Mae/It’s true!
19714/Bruce/heh heh.
19715/Council3/oh ok.
19716/Council2/so you're more of a... drifter?
19717/Bruce/Yeah, but it's temporary...
19718/Council1/Of course! Well, we just wanted to see if you're ok up here.
19719/Bruce/Yeah, Pastor Kate has been very kind.
19720/Council4/Mind if we see your setup here?
19721/Council3/What do you think, Molly?
19722/Molly/Uh
19723/Bruce/Uh
19724/Molly/It's... fine?
19725/Council1/Ha ha! Alright... Bruce?
19726/Bruce/Yeah.
19727/Council3/How are you finding Possum Springs?
19728/Bruce/nice place. nice people.
19729/Council4/how long you been in town, bruce?
19730/Bruce/I been here for a while now...
19731/Bruce/and I was here before back in the 70s.
19732/Bruce/They were looking for miners, at least for a while.
19733/Council4/Got a whole thing going here, Bruce!
19734/Bruce/yup.
19735/Council1/pretty impressive!
19736/Bruce/uh
19737/Bruce/thanks.
19738/Council4/Well, we sure appreciate you talking to us, Bruce.
19739/Council2/It was really great to meet you!
19740/Bruce/Yup. Likewise.
19741/Council1/Alright, troops! Let's move out!
19742/Council3/Thanks again Bruce!
19743/Molly/Thanks, Bruce.
19744/Bruce/no trouble.
19745/Council3/That's quite a setup he has there.
19746/Council2/Sure is.
19747/Council4/When I used to go camp with my dad it wasn't nearly that nice.
19748/Council1/Oh really? We belonged to a hunter's camp north of Possum Jump.
19749/Council4/My father's idea of camping was a bit more rustic.
19750/Council3/Quite a setup, he's got.
19751/Council2/He hasn't harmed anyone.
19752/Council1/*sigh*
19753/Council1/it's a toughie.
19754/Molly/I have things to do.
19755/Council3/I don't know that it serves the interests of the community.
19756/Council1/Either way he shouldn't be sleeping outside.
19757/Council4/Can we discuss this indoors somewhere?
19758/Council1/TO THE CLIK CLAK!
19759/Mae/YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!!!
19760/Mae/oof. This thing smells.
19761/Gregg/That’s just how old machines smell.
19762/Mae/no... like... I think something was living in here.
19763/GreggClamp/Hey.
19764/GreggClamp/I’ve got an idea.
19765/GreggClamp/Why don’t you stop being so negative.
19766/MaeClamp/Why don’t you eat your own neck?
19767/GreggClamp/That’s impossible.
19768/GreggClamp/Be serious.
19769/GreggClamp/This is serious business.
19770/MaeClamp/Oh! Well!
19771/MaeClamp/Well, don’t mind me!
19772/MaeClamp/See, I’ve already died once tonight.
19773/MaeClamp/No big deal or anything!!!!
19774/GreggClamp/What was it like?
19775/Not Stated/I saw a shark I think
19776/MaeClamp/and it told me something important
19777/GreggClamp/what was it?
19778/MaeClamp/i don’t remember.
19779/GreggClamp/couldn’t have been that important then.
19780/MaeClamp/True.
19781/Not Stated/I can taste my tooth fillings
19782/MaeClamp/and it’s like they’re... ringing?
19783/GreggClamp/Ringing.
19784/MaeClamp/Like little bells
19785/MaeClamp/inside my skull.
19786/GreggClamp/Wow.
19787/MaeClamp/Yeah.
19788/GreggClamp/Ok let’s do this!

19793/Mae/Thanks! I think I can figure it out!
19794/Mae/Gotta get rid of these leaves first...
19795/Mae/AAAAAAAAGGGHH!!!

19804/Gregg/Whoa you just ate my crust.
19805/Mae/This was a mistake.
19806/Gregg/oh looks like someone went off to school and got all fancy and eats CRUSTS now
19807/Angus/This pizza isn't great.
19808/Bea/It's pretty horrible.
19809/Gregg/Dudes, haven't you heard of the pizza scale?
19810/Not Stated/The What?
19811/Not Stated/Screw it. Pizza good.
19812/Gregg/That's basically the pizza scale.
19813/Angus/He's explained it to me several times.
19814/Angus/That's about it.
19815/Mae/Pizza good.
19816/Gregg/There's a scale of pizza.
19817/Gregg/On one end there's the worst pizza.
19818/Gregg/But like everything right above that
19819/Gregg/is still really good.
19820/Bea/What's at the other end of the scale?
19821/Gregg/It's pizza all the way up.
19822/Not Stated/Empty Text
19823/Bea/i mean it's no pastabilities.
19824/Mae/mmmm i missed pastabilities.
19825/Gregg/So you're just all about crusts now?
19826/Gregg/like some sort of maniac?
19827/Mae/It's good.
19828/Gregg/Weird.
19829/Gregg/Whoa did you just eat my crust?
19830/Mae/I like crusts!
19831/Gregg/oh looks like someone went off to school and got all fancy and eats CRUSTS now
19832/Mae/I am not touching those crusts.
19833/Gregg/saaaaaaaaaaame.
19834/Mae/we should have gone to pastabilities.
19835/Gregg/the diner has ambience!!!!

19849/MaePaws/Gregg.
19850/MaePaws/These are the most important donuts.
19851/GreggPaws/I am unworthy.
19852/MaePaws/Bow your head, you dirty fox!
19853/MaePaws/We are in the presence of something greater than either of us.
19854/MaePaws/Oh deepest darkest god.
19855/MaePaws/These donuts are a planet unto themselves.
19856/GreggPaws/I've died and gone to donut.
19857/MaePaws/I was dead but the donut gave me life.
19858/GreggPaws/All glories to the donut.
19859/GreggPaws/The donut's best secret is its middle.
19860/MaePaws/The middle is a hole.
19861/GreggPaws/It's nothing, surrounded by [wave]everything.
19862/MaePaws/But I'm sad when I get to the middle.
19863/MaePaws/Just chomping air.
19864/GreggPaws/Naw dude, like the hole makes you appreciate the donut.
19865/GreggPaws/Another thing, the hole is a handy grip!
19866/MaePaws/Yes. How else are you going to pick things up
19867/MaePaws/If they don't have holes in them.
19868/GreggPaws/Naw, it's like a [wave]contrast.
19869/GreggPaws/Like something and nothing.
19870/GreggPaws/And the nothing, like, helps you get a grip.
19871/GreggPaws/On the something.
19872/GreggPaws/Crap, I had it for a second.
19873/MaePaws/Dude, this is getting deep.
19874/GreggPaws/It's the donuts talking.
19875/MaePaws/I think I can see the past and future.
19876/MaePaws/I think I can see the birth and death of all things.
19877/GreggPaws/I can see the sun exploding.
19878/MaePaws/Are we high?
19879/GreggPaws/No, these are just very
19880/GreggPaws/very
19881/GreggPaws/good donuts,

20197/Mae/This is all getting jumbled. I should write it down.
20198/Mae/Hey wow! Ok!
20199/Mae/Now to the top of the tower
20200/Mae/and I can take that wire right into town!
20201/Mae/I hope no one cut the tree down out front of the house.
20202/Mae/I used to make Mr. Penderson so mad
20203/Mae/jumping all over it and running on the powerlines.
20204/Mae/Whatever, everyone does it.
20205/Mae/Practically another sidewalk.
20206/Mae/Looks like the ladder's gone.
20207/Mae/If I could just get to the top of this thing...
20208/Mae/Ugh.
20209/Not Stated/<<wait 1>>​
20210/Mae/e_preta
20211/Mae/I could never make it up onto that tree when I was a kid.
20212/Mae/The number logs mocked me.

20214/Mae/Lemme see if I can visualize this...

20237/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
20238/Mae/Ahoy!
20239/Mae/I definitely remember barely reaching the top of this wheel.
20240/Mae/I definitely remember barely growing since then.
20241/Mae/There used to be one of those spinning block tic tac toe things.
20242/Mae/Because that's why you come to a giant boatcastle.
20243/Mae/To play a dumb game in the dumbest way.
20244/Mae/OH COME ON.
20245/Mae/Don't think I have the upper body strength to climb this...
20246/Mae/You can't keep me out, Possum Springs.
20247/Mae/I am queen of you.
20248/Mae/...
20249/Mae/...could probably just jump off this telephone pole...
20250/Mae/Wow. I haven't been here in maybe 10 years.
20251/Mae/And apparently no one else has.
20252/Mae/I don't know what they were going for here.
20253/Mae/Some sort of boat castle?
20254/Mae/Most of it's gone now.
20255/Mae/Just a thing for weird animals to eat and have babies in.
20256/Mae/I wonder what kind of weird animals have babies in there?
20257/Mae/Dirt Possums. Night Snakes. Mystery beasts of all shapes.
20258/Mae/I remember Cathy Daminco's boyfriend took her here
20259/Mae/to make out and then break up.
20260/Mae/And then the next day Cathy pulled out Cindy Clark's nosering
20261/Mae/at the Fort Lucenne Mall.
20262/Mae/This entire area is so full of romance.
20263/Mae/Hey! You can still see Mr. Snorkles on this!
20264/Mae/Here's a powerline.
20265/Mae/Let's go home.
20266/Mae/wow. We’re up really high.
20267/Mae/and really far out!
20268/Mae/I can’t see town from here
20269/Angus/It’s south of us, behind whatever ridge that is.
20270/Mae/so what, are we just supposed to wait here and see if anything happens?
20271/Angus/you tell me! You’re the expert.
20272/Mae/i guess we’ll just wait here and see if anything happens.
20273/Angus/Nice night.
20274/Mae/Yeah.
20275/Mae/Back at school I couldn’t see as many stars.
20276/Mae/That always made me sad.
20277/Angus/Oh yeah. They’re really nice up here.
20278/Mae/I wish I knew the constellations like you did.
20279/Angus/What?
20280/Mae/You know all the names and the stories and stuff.
20281/Angus/I wish. I can never remember them other than...
20282/Angus/I think that one up there is like a bell or something?
20283/Mae/No. No no no.
20284/Mae/Remember that time we were all at that Longest Night bonfire?
20285/Mae/And we spotted the constellations together
20286/Mae/and you told us all about them???
20287/Angus/That’s not a thing that happened.
20288/Mae/Oh wow. Maybe it was like a dream or something.
20289/Mae/God, I barely remember now.
20290/Angus/I wonder what fake constellations and stories you dreamed up.
20291/Mae/Ok, humor me.
20292/Mae/I’ll find the constellations, you tell me about them.
20293/Angus/ok then.
20294/Mae/graves, huh?
20295/Angus/yeah these were... i forget.
20296/Angus/they were involved in the possum massacre.
20297/Angus/that like labor strike thing
20298/Angus/where it was like the miners vs national guard?
20299/Angus/happened back in town like a hundred years ago.
20300/Mae/why are they up here?
20301/Angus/i think these were some of the bad guys.
20302/Angus/and some of the miners
20303/Angus/didn't want them buried in town.
20304/Mae/oh. huh.
20305/Angus/there's like a few old graveyards up here from like
20306/Angus/colonial times.
20307/Angus/i guess there's one up here somewhere too.
20308/Mae/well.
20309/Mae/that's spooky.
20310/Angus/eh. just bones.
20311/Mae/ancient shark bones!!!
20312/Angus/yeah see? nothing left to be scary.

20316/Angus/ha ha ha.
20317/Angus/yeah.
20318/Angus/Don’t look at him.
20319/Mae/Who?
20320/Angus/There’s someone standing behind us.
20321/Angus/In the trees.
20322/Mae/Holy shit.
20323/Mae/Holy shit.
20324/Mae/What do they look like?
20325/Angus/Tall. Wearing some kind of weird coat.
20326/Angus/Like a utility coat or something.
20327/Mae/oh god
20328/Mae/that’s the ghost
20329/Angus/I’m more worried about it being a living person
20330/Angus/standing in the woods, staring at us
20331/Mae/oh god oh god
20332/Angus/Well
20333/Angus/don’t panic

20501/Mae/Let it be a legend.
20502/Gregg/Hm. Yeah.
20503/Mae/too bad it didn't fall on you.
20504/Gregg/too bad you didn't get your arm caught in the gears.
20505/Angus/too bad both of you didn't get trapped in the car
20506/Angus/after a wreck
20507/Angus/and explode all over the road
20508/Angus/and have to be scraped up
20509/Angus/with a snow shovel.

20515/Mae/yep.
20516/Mae/goodbye.
20517/Gregg/Here are all the parts...
20518/Mae/Wow! So many possible combinations.
20519/Gregg/We can create our own unique metal offspring.
20520/Mae/So we just... clank these together?
20521/Gregg/Yeah slap 'em together, tighten some screws.
20522/Gregg/What could go wrong?
20523/Mae/I mean, quite a lot, lots of times stuff goes wrong.
20524/Gregg/dude you are no fun
20525/Mae/i literally just died
20526/Angus/wow.
20527/Mae/wow?
20528/Angus/my old scout camp
20529/Angus/used to come up here with my troop
20530/Angus/like a decade ago
20531/Mae/you're the ancient sea monster now.
20532/Angus/looks like it.
20533/Angus/Wow. Looks like some of the whirly note things came back.
20534/Mae/the what?
20535/Angus/uh we made these little windmill things
20536/Angus/and each put an anonymous note in them
20537/Angus/attached to this little spring-controlled helicopter
20538/Angus/and the idea was that when the wind would pick up
20539/Angus/the windmill would wind up the helicopter
20540/Angus/and the note would fly away.
20541/Angus/looks like some of them blew back.
20542/Mae/that's... an amazing coincidence.
20543/Angus/oh no that was the idea.
20544/Angus/each year we'd read notes left from the year before.
20545/Mae/i'm gonna see if i can find any more!
20546/Angus/i'm gonna hike up here. been a while.
20547/Mae/Got one!
20548/Mae/Hmm...
20549/Mae/Got one!
20550/Mae/Hmm...
20551/Mae/Got one!
20552/Mae/Hmm...
20553/Mae/Got one!
20554/Mae/Hmm...
20555/Angus/I think you got 'em all!
20556/Angus/from what i can spot at least.
20557/Angus/and i got the high vantage point.
20558/Angus/I think there are some more?
20559/Angus/i spotted 'em.
20560/Mae/Oh cool! Gonna look.
20561/Angus/Aye-aye.
20562/Mae/let's read 'em let's read 'em!
20563/Mae/wait- should we, though?
20564/Mae/we gotta leave 'em for the scouts!!!
20565/Angus/oh, it's fine.
20566/Angus/any ones up here wouldn't last the winter anyway.
20567/Mae/ok ok ok ok let's read one!!!
20568/Angus/ok here's one.
20569/Angus/"hi. i'm not supposed to write my name.
20570/Angus/and that's fine, because i am a scout.
20571/Angus/and that is the only name i need."
20572/Mae/wow. that's intense.
20573/Angus/it goes on.
20574/Angus/"the scouts gave me more than a name,
20575/Angus/they gave me badges. to show my worth."
20576/Mae/geez.
20577/Angus/"i would kill for the scouts."
20578/Angus/that's it.
20579/Mae/were you all like this?
20580/Angus/kinda. sometimes. no. maybe.
20581/Angus/ok let's read this here.
20582/Mae/reeeeeeead it!
20583/Angus/ha ha ha. oh dear.
20584/Mae/what?
20585/Angus/"i am super, super gay."

20587/Mae/angus did you write this one?
20588/Angus/geez. i could have.
20589/Angus/i think my note was about like being strong and good.
20590/Mae/and gay as hell, apparently.
20591/Angus/i think my total gayness came through to the discerning reader.
20592/Angus/alright let's read this note.
20593/Angus/*ahem*
20594/Angus/"i like shooting arrows they are cool to shoot
20595/Angus/in fact i think we should shoot arrows instead of
20596/Angus/guns when we're in the army it has a tactical
20597/Angus/advantage in that it is silent and also
20598/Angus/elegant"
20599/Mae/huh.
20600/Angus/yeah. i got nothing.
20601/Angus/alright this one got kinda torn up
20602/Angus/maybe a bird got it.

20604/Angus/"i am extremely unhappy, and you're the only person who knows."
20605/Mae/oh.
20606/Angus/ok.
20607/Angus/hm.
20608/Mae/what?
20609/Angus/not much changes.
20610/Angus/coulda just as easily been our notes from 10 years ago.
20611/Mae/yeah.
20612/Angus/there's like a
20613/Angus/timelessness
20614/Angus/about people.
20615/Angus/some things just don't stop being
20616/Angus/what we are.
20617/Mae/hmmm.

20636/Mae/I guess.
20637/Selmers/What's that word they use
20638/Selmers/for like a weapon you make in jail?
20639/Selmers/Like a knife?
20640/Mae/A shiv?
20641/Selmers/I hope Dennis gets shivved at work.

21429/Gregg/e_neûtrala_1 e_neûtrala_2
21430/Mae/e_neûtrala_1 e_neûtrala_2
21431/Mae/Found one I think?
21432/Chazokov/Let me have a look.
21433/Chazokov/Ah yes. Castys.
21434/Not Stated/What's Castys?
21435/Not Stated/Totally it is.
21436/Chazokov/You know this one already?
21437/Mae/Nope.
21438/Chazokov/This star tells the story of a woman who built a tower to heaven.
21439/Chazokov/And for this the gods sunk her deep into the sea.
21440/Mae/Wow. That's screwed up.
21441/Chazokov/But even in the depths, she refused to die.
21442/Mae/DAMN STRAIGHT.
21443/Chazokov/Oh, will you never die as well?
21444/Not Stated/I guess, someday.
21445/Not Stated/I dunno.
21446/Not Stated/NEVER.
21447/Chazokov/Beh heh heh heh!
21448/Chazokov/Defy Castys' gods also, will you?
21449/Chazokov/The gods in these stories are only stand-ins
21450/Chazokov/for things we cannot control.
21451/Chazokov/You might say floods, or the cancer, or such.
21452/Mae/No to all of them.
21453/Chazokov/This is fair.
21454/Mae/Found one!
21455/Chazokov/Let me have a look.
21456/Chazokov/Ah yes. Dohr The Murderer.
21457/Mae/Ok I'm interested.
21458/Chazokov/Dohr passed Behrn The King's procession on the street.
21459/Chazokov/Dohr was quiet and said nothing, and the King took offense to this.
21460/Not Stated/Why?
21461/Chazokov/Royalty is strange.
21462/Not Stated/Geez.
21463/Mae/So what happened?
21464/Chazokov/Behrn insulted Dohr, Dohr's family, Dohr's village, and so on
21465/Chazokov/until he was down to insulting Dohr's chickens.
21466/Not Stated/Damn.
21467/Not Stated/Chickens are kind of awful.
21468/Mae/Weird horrible angry dinosaurs.
21469/Mae/They peck each others eyes out!
21470/Chazokov/They are delicious.
21471/Mae/They deserve to be delicious.
21472/Chazokov/Dohr first murdered Behrn's chickens.
21473/Chazokov/then his ancestral village
21474/Chazokov/then his family
21475/Mae/Holy crap.
21476/Chazokov/And when he came to Behrn
21477/Chazokov/the king was silent.
21478/Mae/I'm going to get a tattoo of this guy.
21479/Chazokov/Is Dohr a hero?
21480/Not Stated/Totally.
21481/Not Stated/I dunno
21482/Mae/but it doesn't really matter I think?
21483/Mae/Like if you've been told you're nothing before
21484/Mae/A story like this sounds pretty ok.
21485/Chazokov/Well it is a true story and real people died
21486/Chazokov/and you should feel terrible.
21487/Mae/Seriously?
21488/Chazokov/Beh heh heh.
21489/Chazokov/I believe we have seen both stars visible today.
21490/Mae/Oh really?
21491/Chazokov/They come and go so fast.
21492/Mae/Found one Found one found one!
21493/Chazokov/Let's have a look.
21494/Chazokov/Sterling the seer.
21495/Mae/how come I've never heard of these guys?
21496/Chazokov/eh
21497/Chazokov/by the time they got to these rare stars
21498/Chazokov/the well known myths and legends were taken.
21499/Mae/oh.
21500/Chazokov/This one, Sterling, is a tale of the world changing
21501/Chazokov/and leaving one behind.
21502/Not Stated/these are all gonna be bummers, huh?
21503/Chazokov/that is not for me to say.
21504/Chazokov/is it a bad thing for the world to move on?
21505/Mae/Well i mean this guy probably doesn't think so.
21506/Not Stated/was he not psychic?
21507/Chazokov/who can say?
21508/Chazokov/do we believe any tale occurred?
21509/Mae/hm.
21510/Chazokov/either way, one day his king met a new sage-
21511/Chazokov/an astronomer.
21512/Chazokov/and she showed the king how the planets and stars
21513/Chazokov/orbit in regular patterns, and why.
21514/Chazokov/and the king kicked Sterling out of his quarters
21515/Chazokov/for the seer had long told the king
21516/Chazokov/a different story about the stars.
21517/Not Stated/did Sterling believe his own story?
21518/Chazokov/i believe he did.
21519/Mae/well that's how things go.
21520/Not Stated/that sounds fair.
21521/Chazokov/is there no responsibility
21522/Chazokov/to care for those whose labors
21523/Chazokov/even one's universe
21524/Chazokov/are suddenly replaced with a new one?
21525/Chazokov/are they obsolete?
21526/Not Stated/that's how life is!
21527/Chazokov/so you believe
21528/Chazokov/that some should go hungry
21529/Chazokov/and without homes
21530/Chazokov/because they are no longer useful
21531/Chazokov/to those in power?
21532/Mae/well geez mr. chazokov when you put it that way
21533/Not Stated/no.
21534/Chazokov/what is to be done?
21535/Mae/i don't know.
21536/Mae/uh
21537/Mae/isn't there some other job the king could give him?
21538/Mae/or some way
21539/Mae/where he doesn't have to be useful to the king
21540/Mae/in order to survive?
21541/Chazokov/it's one to ponder!
21542/Chazokov/beh heh heh
21543/Chazokov/the stars! they make one think!
21544/Mae/BOOM!
21545/Mae/Found one!
21546/Chazokov/let's see.
21547/Chazokov/Ah yes! Simone the fighter!
21548/Mae/she got a gun
21549/Chazokov/Simone lived in a good land
21550/Chazokov/but under every good land are the roots of oppression
21551/Chazokov/and in this land those roots took hold
21552/Chazokov/and choked out all else.
21553/Not Stated/that was poetic, Mr. Chazokov
21554/Chazokov/thanks. I was just reading the summary off my phone.
21555/Mae/oh
21556/Chazokov/we may not have signal, but we have wifi!
21557/Not Stated/geez.
21558/Chazokov/it happens faster than one can imagine
21559/Chazokov/Anyway, when the borders closed and the curfew began
21560/Chazokov/Simone and her comrades began to plot.
21561/Chazokov/they infiltrated, they sabotaged, they freed prisoners.
21562/Mae/very nice.
21563/Chazokov/Simone was one of the first to be identified
21564/Chazokov/but she evaded capture even as the wanted posters went up.
21565/Chazokov/As whispers of her grew throughout the land
21566/Chazokov/more and more of her neighbors prayed in the night
21567/Chazokov/that Simone would be their salvation.
21568/Not Stated/was she?
21569/Not Stated/that's a lot of pressure for one person.
21570/Chazokov/She was not alone, of course.
21571/Chazokov/she was but one part in a growing organism
21572/Chazokov/but she became a symbol.
21573/Chazokov/it is difficult to think of many things
21574/Chazokov/so sometimes having a symbol for all of them
21575/Chazokov/is important.
21576/Mae/like numbers.
21577/Chazokov/We do not know where Simone is buried.
21578/Mae/ah goddammit. i knew this wasn't going to be happy.
21579/Chazokov/we do know that when things boiled over
21580/Chazokov/she led a charge against the palace gates
21581/Chazokov/and behind those gates were cannons.
21582/Mae/oh no.
21583/Chazokov/many years later when the mass graves were exhumed
21584/Chazokov/her bones were mixed with so many others
21585/Chazokov/it was said that she now lives on
21586/Chazokov/in the bones of all in her country.
21587/Mae/geez. that got dark. and sad. and spooky.
21588/Chazokov/Beh heh heh.
21589/Chazokov/that is history!
21590/Chazokov/That's both of them for today!
21591/Mae/neato!
21592/Mae/FOUND! ONE!
21593/Chazokov/LET'S! SEE!
21594/Chazokov/big snake.
21595/Mae/"big snake?"
21596/Chazokov/yep.
21597/Not Stated/anything else?
21598/Not Stated/i saw a big snake once.
21599/Chazokov/at the zoo?
21600/Mae/in scouts we were hiking
21601/Mae/and one was sunning itself on a rock.
21602/Chazokov/what a treat!
21603/Mae/i was thinking it's rare to see a snake just randomly relaxing.
21604/Mae/what's up with this one?
21605/Chazokov/Big Snake emerged from the earth and made war upon the villages.
21606/Mae/what villages?
21607/Chazokov/you know. villages.
21608/Mae/ok.
21609/Chazokov/and as he wrapped himself around them
21610/Chazokov/the villagers saw that they were encircled by the same-
21611/Mae/big snake
21612/Chazokov/- and they came together
21613/Chazokov/and together slew the-
21614/Mae/big snake.
21615/Chazokov/you learn.
21616/Mae/why did big snake attack the people?
21617/Chazokov/do you have sympathy for the big snake?
21618/Mae/geez i dunno but can we just keep saying big snake?
21619/Chazokov/big snake
21620/Mae/big snake
21621/Chazokov/big
21622/Mae/snake
21623/Mae/Star located, captain.
21624/Chazokov/Let us consult the guide.
21625/Chazokov/oh, you will like this one.
21626/Mae/really?
21627/Chazokov/because they are dead.
21628/Mae/ok yeah i'm into it.
21629/Chazokov/Gramercy The Medium
21630/Chazokov/in life he spoke with the dead?
21631/Mae/really?
21632/Chazokov/who knows.
21633/Chazokov/but when he died
21634/Chazokov/his own spirit returned and spoke through him.
21635/Mae/wait. that's dumb.
21636/Chazokov/how so?
21637/Not Stated/that's just called being alive
21638/Chazokov/not so! his body was dead!
21639/Mae/so he was like a zombie?
21640/Chazokov/but just as smart as before!
21641/Chazokov/no looking for brains.
21642/Mae/so like normal but he smelled bad?
21643/Chazokov/just so.
21644/Mae/why did they make this guy into a star?
21645/Chazokov/i have no idea.
21646/Mae/i guess it's kind of impressive.
21647/Mae/dumb, but impressive.
21648/Not Stated/how did... wait... what?
21649/Chazokov/his own spirit possessed his body.
21650/Mae/that's like literally the same thing as being alive.
21651/Chazokov/no, he was dead but possessed
21652/Mae/by himself.
21653/Chazokov/yes.
21654/Mae/oh god this is dumb.
21655/Mae/so what's the moral of this one?
21656/Chazokov/moral?
21657/Mae/yeah usually star things like this have some sort of moral.
21658/Chazokov/sometimes things are just strange!
21659/Mae/that's the moral?
21660/Chazokov/beh heh heh
21661/Chazokov/That is our pair for the day!
21662/Mae/Well gee willikers, Mr. Chazokov!
21663/Chazokov/beh heh heh
21664/Chazokov/"willikers".
21665/Mae/I think I got one?
21666/Chazokov/let us see.
21667/Chazokov/Kol the mountaineer.
21668/Mae/Kol.
21669/Mae/Knew a guy named Cole once? That's close?
21670/Chazokov/it is.
21671/Mae/so what's up with this guy?
21672/Chazokov/Kol was from a flat land.
21673/Mae/this midwest?
21674/Chazokov/whatever the midwest of wherever he was from was.
21675/Mae/every place has a midwest.
21676/Chazokov/this is true.
21677/Chazokov/he dreamed of mountains
21678/Chazokov/and devoted his life to climbing them.
21679/Mae/...because his hometown was flat?
21680/Chazokov/isn't this a common instinct?
21681/Chazokov/to seek that which is unlike where one grows up?
21682/Not Stated/yeah
21683/Mae/i mean people go to the city a lot.
21684/Mae/like they move there because it's got stuff
21685/Mae/and there's more people like them maybe.
21686/Mae/sucks though. not everyone can just up and leave.
21687/Chazokov/when I left my country
21688/Chazokov/i felt this same thing.
21689/Chazokov/but i have not regretted it.
21690/Mae/you like possum springs?
21691/Chazokov/it is beautiful in ways perhaps invisible
21692/Chazokov/to those who have seen it every day of their lives.
21693/Not Stated/not really.
21694/Mae/I like home.
21695/Mae/I like my neighborhood
21696/Mae/I like the bad diner food.
21697/Chazokov/it is not good.
21698/Mae/but it's good bad
21699/Mae/like a story a your friend wrote
21700/Mae/and gave you to read.
21701/Chazokov/i like the disco fries.
21702/Mae/so what happened to Kol?
21703/Chazokov/he returned home
21704/Chazokov/and complained that the sky felt heavy
21705/Chazokov/he had been up into the clouds
21706/Chazokov/and now they rested hard upon him.
21707/Mae/that's a really specific complaint.
21708/Chazokov/when one leaves a place
21709/Chazokov/one brings something back when one returns.
21710/Mae/one.
21711/Chazokov/one.
21712/Mae/Gotcha!
21713/Chazokov/oooh... which one is this?
21714/Chazokov/Adina Astra
21715/Mae/!!!!
21716/Chazokov/you know this one?
21717/Mae/YES! I KNOW THIS ONE!!!!
21718/Chazokov/It's a common story.
21719/Chazokov/how Adina journeyed to the frozen lake
21720/Chazokov/how she traversed unknown faraway lands
21721/Mae/i was very into Adina stories when I was a kid.
21722/Chazokov/so you must know what became of her?
21723/Mae/...yeah
21724/Chazokov/how she, in her quest,
21725/Chazokov/turned her back on the sky
21726/Chazokov/and journeyed down into the earth
21727/Chazokov/where her stars were no longer over her head
21728/Chazokov/and how she was never seen again?
21729/Mae/yeah.
21730/Mae/whatever.
21731/Chazokov/is that not a sad ending?
21732/Not Stated/yeah. i mean, she probably died.
21733/Chazokov/she lived well. she did many amazing things.
21734/Chazokov/it is not sad to die having done so much.
21735/Mae/i guess. still sucks. dying.
21736/Chazokov/it is a shame.
21737/Not Stated/no. disappearing isn't the same as dying.
21738/Mae/she probably went somewhere else completely
21739/Mae/and did all kinds of cool shit.
21740/Chazokov/oh my!
21741/Mae/yeah so. whatever.
21742/Chazokov/Ooof! That's all for the day!
21743/Mae/That was nice.
21744/Mae/Found it!
21745/Chazokov/let us consult the guide.
21746/Chazokov/Erskine The Firemaker.
21747/Mae/"the firemaker?"
21748/Chazokov/a wanderer in the cold and dark
21749/Chazokov/making a fire and huddling up to it.
21750/Chazokov/for light and warmth.
21751/Mae/sounds festive.
21752/Chazokov/sounds like survival.
21753/Mae/hm.
21754/Mae/this star makes me want to cry.
21755/Chazokov/crying? on my roof?
21756/Chazokov/do you wish to talk about it?
21757/Mae/no. it's fine.
21758/Chazokov/is it a happy cry, or a sad cry?
21759/Mae/i dunno. i don't have great words for it.
21760/Chazokov/it is ok.
21761/Chazokov/sometimes too many words.
21762/Mae/yeah.
21763/Mae/thank you for this.
21764/Chazokov/thank you for joining me.
21765/Chazokov/I think we have discovered... them all?
21766/Mae/Well, we didn't really discover them, right?
21767/Mae/i mean someone else already saw them and named them
21768/Mae/wrote a whole bunch of stuff about them
21769/Mae/and we just like
21770/Mae/found what they made for us.
21771/Chazokov/is that not a discovery?
21772/Mae/not really.
21773/Chazokov/maybe not in the historical sense
21774/Chazokov/we did not create the stars
21775/Chazokov/or name them
21776/Chazokov/but we had these autumn afternoons
21777/Chazokov/and found them together.
21778/Chazokov/isn't that something?
21779/Mae/something something something.
21780/Mae/my granddad said something like that once.
21781/Mae/something about a story having really happened
21782/Mae/because hearing it happened to you.
21783/Chazokov/that is nice.
21784/Mae/it's not bad.
21785/Mae/HOLY CRAP my eyes!!
21786/Chazokov/Oh - you want to put the filter on like so...
21787/Mae/GEEZ!!
21788/Chazokov/The sun is bright! Make you blind!
21789/Mae/You didn't think to mention this?
21790/Chazokov/I just did!
21791/Mae/Whaaaaaaaargh my eyes!!
21792/Chazokov/Filter!
21793/Mae/Uuuugh.
21794/Mae/AAARGH I'M BLIND!!
21795/Chazokov/This is your own fault at this point I would say.
21796/Mae/Hmm... I can't figure this out
21797/Not Stated/Give Up
21798/Not Stated/Try Again
21799/Mae/I think I have a great-great-uncle or something on this.
21800/Mae/Yep, there you go. Anselm Borowski.
21801/Mae/"Anselm?"
21802/Mae/Even in life, he was tragic.
21803/Mae/A possum on top, of course. Always, always a possum.
21804/Mae/We like our war monuments in Possum Springs.
21805/Mae/There are 2 really ancient ones over in Olde Possum Springs.
21806/Mae/Three in town proper.
21807/Mae/And I think they put a new one up on Pill Hill.
21808/Mae/There's one up by Possum Jump, but that one's spooky.
21809/Mae/I haven't been up there since that party we're not going to think about.
21810/Mae/Years ago I thought when I was 20 I'd never be able to climb this high up anymore.
21811/Mae/Shows what you know, little Mae.
21812/Mae/...
21813/Mae/I think these are supposed to be weather stations?
21814/Mae/Pioneer Scouts made them when they weren't playing football
21815/Mae/or learning about [wave]MANHOOD[/wave].
21816/Mae/These are the manliest of miniature windmills for sure.
21817/Mae/My god.
21818/Mae/What kind of weather did I miss?
21819/Mae/This is nuts.
21820/Mae/Oh well, wasn't going to church anyway.
21821/Gregg/e_krinĝega
21822/Travis/You suck, Mae.
21823/Mae/...
21824/Travis/Yeah, you heard me.
21825/Mae/......
21826/Travis/You suck.
21827/Mae/You are the WORST.
21828/Travis/My car got trashed.
21829/Mae/Maybe if you weren't such a jerk...
21830/Travis/Wait what? Where's this coming from?
21831/Mae/Maybe it was... carma.
21832/Travis/Like Karma?
21833/Mae/N-no... You don't. Oh.
21834/Travis/Nice.
21835/Mae/CAUTION: Do not jump on street lights.
21836/Mae/Do not run on power lines.
21837/Mae/Do not leap between roofs.
21838/Mae/You could die.
21839/Mae/Thank you!
21840/Mae/So... um... what happened?
21841/Gregg/Snuck into the elevator
21842/Gregg/but when I got out here the window shut behind me.
21843/Mae/Why were you coming up here to begin with, dude?
21844/Mae/You're not exactly cut out for jumping around roofs.
21845/Gregg/I guess I'm just not feeling it today
21846/Gregg/so I thought I'd throw something off the roof.
21847/Gregg/Oh yeah, I also stole a garden gnome.
21848/Mae/Just having one of your off-days?
21849/Gregg/I guess.
21850/Mae/I was thinking before of what would happen
21851/Mae/if I burned myself alive in my bedroom.
21852/Gregg/ok. e_neûtrala_1 e_mira
21853/Mae/I was thinking that I'd totally haunt here forever.
21854/Mae/Just really bum everyone out.
21855/Gregg/Oh dude I'd bite everyone in the ass.
21856/Gregg/They'd be like what the hell, who just bit my ass???
21857/Gregg/RAWR ASSBITE!!!!![/shake] e_kria
21858/Gregg/e_neûtrala_1
21859/Mae/I was thinking about being here forever.
21860/Mae/Or being anywhere forever.
21861/Mae/Like a dracula.
21862/Gregg/If I was gonna haunt someplace forever, I don't know if it'd be Possum Springs.
21863/Gregg/This town sucks. This town is a dracula.
21864/Gregg/Tell you what:
21865/Gregg/You go down, ride the elevator back up and let me back in.
21866/Gregg/Then we can borrow Bea's car and go to Donut Wolf.
21867/Mae/I dunno... Bea and I aren't really...
21868/Gregg/No it's cool, me and angus borrow it all the time.
21869/Mae/Sweet dude. Did you want to throw this gnome?
21870/Gregg/I dunno. What do you think?
21871/Not Stated/Naw dude. This gnome's partying with us tonight.
21872/Not Stated/Obviously. This isn't even a question.
21873/Gregg/Yep, that did it. I feel better.
21874/Mae/Good dude.
21875/Gregg/Can we get off this roof now?
21876/Mae/I am never gonna let you live this down.
21877/Gregg/Hey asscat, you want Donut Wolf or not? e_krinĝa

21892/Mae/Adults.
21893/PoleWorker/Oh ho ho I don’t think so.
21894/PoleWorker/Adults got jobs and better things to do anyway.
21895/Mae/Ah.

21899/Mae/I desperately need to get to church.
21900/PoleWorker/Tomorrow, I think.
21901/Mae/The vampires can't go on sacred ground.
21902/PoleWorker/I ain’t seen no vampires around here.
21903/PoleWorker/'cept maybe the government
21904/PoleWorker/Suckin' us dry!
21905/Mae/You've taken over my vampire story.

21918/Mae/You from around here?
21919/Bruce/No.
21920/Mae/You from off the train, then?
21921/Bruce/Got sick, had to stop. Everyone knows not to stop in Possum Springs anymore.
21922/Mae/On account of our stringent vagrancy policy?
21923/Bruce/Some hold their breaths when we roll through town.
21924/Mae/Uh huh? So what are you doing up here?
21925/Bruce/Sleeping. Keeping off the streets.
21926/Mae/Can't be very warm.
21927/Bruce/It's a lot colder in the west end of town. Best keep high and eastward.
21928/Mae/Ok then, we'll I'll be going...
21929/Bruce/At dusk I have to make it to the tracks and hop anything out of here.
21930/Bruce/But truth is, I'm too afraid to leave this roof.
21931/Mae/Afraid of what?
21932/Bruce/"Don't get off in Possum Springs." I knew that.
21933/Bruce/I got off here. I screwed up.
21934/Mae/What are you afraid of?
21935/Bruce/...
21936/Mae/Hey listen, dude, I mean if you want to hang out up here I don't care.
21937/Mae/Just don't like steal anything or eat anyone's pet or whatever.
21938/Mae/I mean hey, we all have hard times, and
21939/Bruce/I don't want to talk to you anymore.
21940/Bruce/Please go away.
21941/Bruce/...
21942/Mae/I thought he stopped doing the peeing thing.
21943/Mae/Something must be pretty wrong.
21944/Mae/'sup!
21945/Mae/You guys are still in highschool, right?
21946/Teen3/Yeah probably.
21947/Mae/Man, me and Gregg totally set that place on fire once! e_ĝoja
21948/Teen1/You didn't burn it down, though.
21949/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
21950/Mae/No, but I mean...
21951/Teen2/So the story here is that you didn't burn the school down.
21952/Teen1/That's easy to do.
21953/Teen3/Look at us. We're also not burning down the school.
21954/Teen2/But you don't see us bragging about it.
21955/Mae/I'm not bragging! e_malĝoja
21956/Teen1/Oh ok then. What did you want?
21957/Mae/Nothing! Geez!

21966/Teen1/Yeah I think he's stuck on the roof.
21967/Mae/Wait what?
21968/Teen2/Yeah I think he went up there and got locked out.
21969/Teen3/He looks so sad.
21970/Teen1/I was gonna call my mom to tell her to call the fire department, but...
21971/Mae/Why is he up on the roof?
21972/Teen2/Pssh. I don't know, and I'm not his [color=EC4D67][wave]best friend[/all].
21973/Teen3/You are such a dick.

21984/SteveScriggins/to burn off all the building scrap stuff that isn't copper.
21985/Mae/Um
21986/SteveScriggins/Because of all the stuff in it the fire burns like 10 times hotter.
21987/Mae/...
21988/SteveScriggins/You can't get near it without dying!
21989/SteveScriggins/You should come sometime!
21990/Mae/no.
21991/SteveScriggins/ok.
21992/SteveScriggins/Steve Scriggins

21994/SteveScriggins/You may remember my handiwork, I locked that [color=999999]teacher...
21995/Mae/...in the supply closet...
21996/SteveScriggins/IN THE [color=999999]SUPPLY CLOSET
21997/Mae/...before Christmas break. He was in there for

22000/SteveScriggins/YEAH HE DID!
22001/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
22002/Not Stated/Why did you do that?
22003/Not Stated/Didn't he die from that?
22004/SteveScriggins/e_nescianta
22005/SteveScriggins/I'm a [color=999999][wave]menace!
22006/SteveScriggins/Nope, he walked into an open sewer!
22007/Mae/Oh my god really?
22008/SteveScriggins/Excellent death!
22009/Mae/Wow, yeah. Excellent death.
22010/SteveScriggins/Inspiring. I hope I go out like that or in a shootout with the cops.
22011/Mae/Those are both very attainable goals.
22012/SteveScriggins/...[wave]EXCELLENT
22013/Mae/I saw a weird possum over there last week. Still filled with such dread.
22014/Mae/I could go visit Angus at work or hit the Snack Falcon, but I dunno.
22015/Mae/They're over there.
22016/Mae/With the possum.
22017/Mae/Is there anything more depressing than the vacant ruins of the party barn?
22018/Mae/I'm too depressed to go any further.
22019/Mae/Aw!!! everything is so great and harfesty!!!
22020/Mae/which is basically just a less spooky halloween?
22021/Mae/whatever!

22027/Council2/That ferris wheel looks like a nightmare.
22028/Council3/Thanks, Colleen. That's helpful.
22029/Council1/What's wrong with it?
22030/Council2/I don't trust giant load-bearing machines you can assemble and disassemble in one day.
22031/Council1/It's the Hit Record! We've always had the Hit Record at Harfest!
22032/Council4/Yeah. Since 1984.
22033/Council3/Maybe that's a clue that we should retire it.
22034/Council4/SHUT UP ANDREW.
22035/Council2/Ok everyone let's just take a step back here and cool down.
22036/Council1/WE. ARE. GOING. TO. HAVE. THE. HIT. RECORD. AT. HAR. FEST. TO. NIGHT!!!

22059/Mae/"Anselm?"
22060/Mae/Even in life, he was tragic.
22061/Mae/We like our war monuments in Possum Springs.

22067/Mae/I mean Gregg still has that helmet from World War 1...
22068/Mae/With the bullet hole in it...
22069/Mae/Like 10 guys from my high school class went off to army.
22070/Mae/Gotta afford college some way or another.
22071/Mae/I've never been to war.
22072/Mae/Not like the recruiter didn't try, though.
22073/Mae/Hard.
22074/Mae/War is some bullshit.
22075/Mae/You hear me, statue?
22076/Mae/I guess you were drafted.
22077/Mae/ugh.
22078/Mae/you died before you got to enjoy the statue they made of you.
22079/Mae/it's garbage.
22080/Mae/they can't make me go to war.
22081/Mae/i'll go underground.
22082/Mae/i'll join some sort of group that's against war and stuff.
22083/Mae/we'll blow up war stuff and sabotage other... war stuff.
22084/Mae/i'll live in the shadows for decades.
22085/Mae/no address.
22086/Mae/always on the run.
22087/Mae/living in a trailer in the desert.
22088/Mae/it'll be awesome.

22090/Mae/Stairs is open for business!
22091/Mae/wonder what's going on up there?
22092/Donna/What?
22093/TZEmployee2/And where exactly are you planning on going?
22094/Donna/I dunno. Ham Panther?
22095/TZEmployee2/But honey you're only gonna get minimum there.
22096/TZEmployee2/And I hear they're murder...
22097/Donna/*THIS* place is murder.
22098/Donna/I don't think I can handle one more incoming call.
22099/Donna/I wake up sometimes because I hear that *BING* noise.
22100/TZEmployee2/Nowadays I just take a sleeping aid. Works wonders.
22101/Donna/We shouldn't have to drug ourselves to get our sleep back from this job!
22102/TZEmployee2/Well, Ham Panther isn't gonna give you a bonus.
22103/TZEmployee2/Ham Panther doesn't even have a leaderboard.
22104/Donna/But it isn't calls.
22105/Donna/It isn't sales.
22106/Donna/I wouldn't be  waiting for that *BING*.
22107/TZEmployee2/I don't know, honey...
22108/TZEmployee2/Maybe you'll have a good shift today and get on the leaderboard
22109/TZEmployee2/And we'll see how you feel then?
22110/Donna/I guess. But it won’t change anything.
22111/Mae/Hey Bea.
22112/Bea/Yyyyo.
22113/Mae/Sorry about last night.
22114/Mae/I get woozy on cold medicine.
22115/Mae/So I don't really know what I expected to happen.
22116/Bea/Sorry for what I said.
22117/Mae/You know, I don't really remember it much.
22118/Mae/So whatevs.

22121/Mae/Band practice later?
22122/Bea/Ha ha. Yep.
22123/Mae/I'm amazed it's still a thing.
22124/Mae/We were barely even a band in highschool.
22125/Bea/Eh. It's fun. Get to hang out with Angus.
22126/Mae/How did you even end up doing it?
22127/Bea/When Casey left town, Angus told me that Gregg was really sad.
22128/Bea/So I volunteered to be the new drummer.
22129/Mae/Well, "drummer."
22130/Mae/It's a laptop, Bea.
22131/Bea/It sure is, Mae. It sure is.
22132/Mae/Hey cat.
22133/Mae/How’d you get up here?
22134/Mae/You put in all of this effort just to sleep?
22135/Mae/I have rarely related more to an animal.
22136/Mae/Here, at the end of the world:
22137/Mae/a sleeping cat.
22138/Mae/Hey cat.
22139/Mae/When I was little I never thought I’d be able to get up here.
22140/Mae/And you’re like half the size of little me.
22141/Mae/You win.
22142/Mae/Takes a lot of parties to keep a barn open.
22143/Mae/I don’t know how it even survived as long as it did.
22144/Mae/I don’t think Gregg got permission to have band practice here.
22145/Mae/We are so gonna get evicted.
22146/Mae/Then the barn shall once again be silent.
22147/Mae/I am not climbing these stairs today. Don't need to go to church.
22148/Mae/No gods, no masters, no effing stairs today please.
22149/Mae/Hey!
22150/Saleem/Hello.
22151/Mae/I'm Mae!
22152/Saleem/Hello Mae, I'm Saleem.
22153/Mae/Are you a busker? Are you busking?
22154/Saleem/What’s busking?
22155/Mae/I don’t know.
22156/Mae/I think it’s when you play outside and people give you money.
22157/Saleem/Are you gonna give me money?
22158/Mae/No.
22159/Saleem/then I’m not busking.
22160/Mae/Cool.
22161/Mae/Still up here?
22162/Saleem/I mean, I left and went to work and so forth since we met.
22163/Mae/Hm
22164/Mae/is that a fiddle?
22165/Saleem/it's a violin.
22166/Mae/that's like the same thing, right?
22167/Saleem/it's a violin, i assure you.
22168/Mae/Has anyone complained?
22169/Saleem/About what?
22170/Mae/You playing.
22171/Saleem/I don’t think anyone cares, honestly.
22172/Saleem/or they like it.
22173/Saleem/i'm fine either way.
22174/Mae/I just met someone else playing by themselves
22175/Saleem/Really?
22176/Mae/Yeah. Across town in the abandoned building by the Clik Clak.
22177/Mae/they had one of those big saxophones.
22178/Saleem/Hm.
22179/Mae/I just thought it was an interesting coincidence.
22180/Saleem/Small town.
22181/Mae/You know that woman I mentioned across town?
22182/Mae/I think she’s looking for people to play with.
22183/Saleem/really?
22184/Mae/Yeah. Just saying.
22185/Mae/I told her I’d mention it.
22186/Saleem/I’ll keep it in mind.
22187/Mae/I'm not saying you *HAVE* to go play with her or anything-
22188/Saleem/I get it.
22189/Mae/I don't want to make this weird,
22190/Saleem/It'll be a lot less weird when you stop making it weird!
22191/Mae/So there's this woman across town.
22192/Mae/Sadie.
22193/Saleem/ok?
22194/Mae/like up in the abandoned building by the clik clak?
22195/Saleem/oooooook?
22196/Mae/anyway she's playing saxophone by herself all the time
22197/Mae/maybe you two could play together?
22198/Mae/since you're also doing basically the same thing.
22199/Saleem/oh. hm.
22200/Mae/I told her I’d mention it.
22201/Saleem/I’ll keep it in mind.
22202/Mae/I'm not saying you *HAVE* to go play with her or anything-
22203/Saleem/I get it.
22204/Mae/I don't want to make this weird,
22205/Saleem/It'll be a lot less weird when you stop making it weird!
22206/WindowAngry/HEY! GET DOWN FROM THERE!
22207/Mae/Hey. It’s you.
22208/Janitor/yep yep.
22209/Janitor/For now at least.
22210/Mae/You know, I never got your name.
22211/Janitor/I’m the Janitor.
22212/Janitor/I clean up, do fixits.
22213/Janitor/Whatever needs done.
22214/Mae/Oh. Ok.
22215/Janitor/So what’s it been like being home again?
22216/Janitor/Things like you remember ‘em?
22217/Not Stated/Kinda.
22218/Not Stated/No.
22219/Mae/I don’t know.
22220/Mae/I don't even remember today.
22221/Janitor/Sounds like you been through something.
22222/Mae/How did you know?
22223/Janitor/Call it experience.
22224/Janitor/I swear some mornings I feel every bit as old as these trees.
22225/Mae/You know, something big did happen
22226/Mae/and I feel like I should have woken up today
22227/Mae/and like, have learned something.
22228/Mae/But I don’t know if I learned anything, really.
22229/Janitor/Weeeell,
22230/Janitor/in my experience the big things don’t teach you anything
22231/Janitor/but they make you something
22232/Janitor/and sometimes you gotta wait a while and see what come of it.
22233/Mae/huh.
22234/Janitor/Welp, done an honest day’s work.
22235/Janitor/quittin’ time!

22243/Mae/i can’t believe they just leave the band stuff in there
22244/Mae/what if someone steals it?
22245/Mae/what if the building falls down?
22246/Mae/i should start taking gregg’s bass home.
22247/Mae/just ya know… in case.
22248/Mae/Hm. used to sometimes see other people up here.
22249/Mae/is this not a thing anymore?

22415/Mae/I don’t think Angus is working today.
22416/Mae/Who goes to a video store anyway?
22417/Mae/I wonder if it’s just weird creepos going to the adult vhs section.
22418/Mae/Creepo: one who demands their porn be delivered via obsolete machines.
22419/Mae/I mean, the rest of us use modern machines like civilized people.
22420/Mae/Granddad read me a story once
22421/Mae/about a sailor whose ship was sinking
22422/Mae/and he climb up one of the ship... poles?...
22423/Mae/and the ship landed on some coral or something before it totally sank
22424/Mae/and he was stuck on the ship pole for a week
22425/Mae/watching the sharks circle.
22426/Mae/Mast! It’s called a mast.
22427/Mae/Sounds better than ship pole.
22428/Mae/Dude ate sea birds and drank hurricane rain.
22429/Mae/Saw sea-ghosts.
22430/Mae/Dude was rad.
22431/Mae/Could hike out to the abandoned Food Donkey.

22439/Mae/no more pizza delivery!
22440/Mae/no more Big Sal!
22441/Mae/no more special birthdays.
22442/Mae/this is the worst thing that’s happened to this town
22443/Mae/since the flood that took out
22444/Not Stated/the petting zoo
22445/Mae/thank goodness all the animals swam to safety
22446/Mae/on the roof of the tire place.
22447/Mae/who knew goats were such good swimmers?
22448/Not Stated/the minigolf ice cream place.
22449/Mae/summer nights.
22450/Mae/eating ice cream.
22451/Mae/playing some putt-putt.
22452/Mae/all washed away.
22453/Mae/i am so freaking DEPRESSED now.
22454/Mae/whoa.
22455/Mae/is someone moving in?
22456/Mae/probably something dumb.
22457/Mae/i miss you, pizza place.
22458/Mae/wow.
22459/Mae/our very own taco place.
22460/Mae/HOLY CRAP!!!!!
22461/Mae/A...
22462/Mae/AAAAAAAH
22463/Mae/A TACO PLACE!!!!
22464/Mae/this is the best thing that’s happened to this town since
22465/Not Stated/they got rid of all those snakes in the diner!
22466/Mae/the owners were religious
22467/Mae/and they called in a preacher
22468/Mae/from one of the holiness camps up in the hills.
22469/Mae/and he got in there and yelled at the snakes to leave.
22470/Mae/the next day after he died they just set traps.
22471/Mae/nobody knows where they came from
22472/Mae/or why they moved in.
22473/Mae/but they’re long gone now.
22474/Not Stated/we got internet!
22475/Mae/we were still using CyberFish until like 2 years ago.
22476/Mae/because it’s eternally 2 decades behind here.
22477/Mae/takes you 3 days to torrent a movie.
22478/Mae/takes you 1 day to load a gif.
22479/Mae/barbaric times.
22480/Mae/god.
22481/Mae/life moves on, huh.
22482/Mae/oh my god! They deliver!!!
22483/Mae/I’m gonna eat the shit out of some tacos.
22484/Mae/so how did that arm get here…
22485/Mae/someone just running down the street
22486/Mae/“whoops my arm fell off!”
22487/Mae/“i’ll just come back for that later!”
22488/Mae/no one could survive their arm just falling off
22489/Mae/or being chopped off
22490/Mae/like, not by a doctor.
22491/Mae/is it still called assault if you chop an arm off?
22492/Mae/seems like it should be a different word.
22493/Mae/“armchoppy”
22494/Mae/you are under arrest for armchoppy!
22495/Mae/whoever’s arm that was is probably dead.
22496/Mae/nah. Definitely.
22497/Mae/unless I see someone walking around
22498/Mae/who until recently had an arm.
22499/Mae/now here’s a man who loved statues.
22500/Mae/don’t get a lot of people getting statues made of themselves today.
22501/Mae/we’re secure in ourselves, ok.
22502/Mae/we don’t need statues to make us feel better.
22503/Mae/if i got a statue i’d have them make me real tall
22504/Mae/what the hell is a malt?
22505/Mae/“too”?
22506/Mae/is that like “two”
22507/Mae/or like “also”
22508/Mae/this is an error so bad even i wouldn’t make it.
22509/Mae/also where was the other video outpost?
22510/Bargoer2/It's wet and I'm cold.
22511/Bargoer1/The smelters wouldn't say that.
22512/Bargoer2/Hell no - Smelters play in any weather!
22513/Bargoer1/Come rain or come shine, it's always Smelter Weather.

23019/Mae/don't mention it.
23020/Mae/I’m gonna need some kind of teen interpreter
23021/Mae/if I’m gonna come down here.
23022/Mae/My god, I’m 20 and they’re already like aliens.
23023/Mae/Oh my old bones.
23024/Mae/Hey kids!
23025/TunnelTeen1/Hey adult.
23026/Mae/Well I was your age only a few years ago.
23027/TunnelTeen2/Uh huh.
23028/Mae/...
23029/Mae/Well, see ya later!
23030/Council1/Because this mural is of historical note, Molly!
23031/Council1/What do we know?
23032/Molly/Well, sometime overnight
23033/Molly/someone used bolt cutters on the gate
23034/Molly/and came down here.
23035/Council1/What’d they use, a paint roller?
23036/Molly/Looks to be.
23037/Council3/Says they intend to Nuke Poss... something?
23038/Molly/I think it’s likely some kid
23039/Molly/saw one of the old Nuke Possum Springs tags from back when
23040/Molly/and got bored halfway through writing it.
23041/Council4/We need to treat this as a terrorist action.
23042/Molly/I’m... sorry?
23043/Council1/This mural is of historical note!
23044/Molly/Alright well I’ll round up any… uh… terrorists I see.
23045/Council3/Round up any dirtbag teens or vagrants that’ve been hanging around town
23046/Council1/check out by the abandoned Food Donkey.
23047/Council4/they come off the train there
23048/Molly/Already on it.
23049/Council1/Molly.
23050/Molly/Yeah?
23051/Council1/Find whoever did this.
23052/Molly/Ok.
23053/Council1/I want to see them hang.
23054/Molly/I think at most they’d get a fine and some jail time.
23055/Council3/this was of historical note.
23056/Council4/without this I don't know if there's a reason to keep this place open
23057/Council3/yeah cathleen we all know what you think
23058/Council4/what? You think I wanted this?
23059/Council4/it's not like any of you had ideas for this place!
23060/Council1/cathleen, we are not going to put a rest home down here!
23061/Council4/it's just wasted space!
23062/Council4/And they're down here anyway at Trolleyside News everyday!
23063/Council2/We are not putting our eldery in a hole!
23064/Council1/Yeah colleen!
23065/Molly/'Least if we closed it I wouldn't have to keep an eye on this place.
23066/Council3/thank you, molly. That's helpful.
23067/Molly/If you're all done I got things to do.
23068/Council1/Yeah fine.
23069/Council3/This was of historical note.
23070/Council2/this sure is a picture.
23071/TunnelTeen1/Hey don't you know Lori?
23072/Mae/Yeah.
23073/TunnelTeen1/Oh ok.
23074/TunnelTeen2/I thought so
23075/TunnelTeen3/So you're like a college dropout, right?
23076/Not Stated/Mind your damn business!
23077/TunnelTeen2/Fine.
23078/Not Stated/Yeah I guess.
23079/TunnelTeen3/What happened?
23080/TunnelTeen4/You fail out?
23081/Not Stated/Mind your damn business!
23082/TunnelTeen4/Fine.
23083/Not Stated/It just didn't work out.
23084/TunnelTeen4/What does that mean?
23085/TunnelTeen1/Yeah what?
23086/Mae/I had kind of a slow nervous breakdown.
23087/TunnelTeen1/Cool.
23088/Mae/Well... ok sure.
23089/Mae/Hey hey! Gimme all yer pretzels!
23090/Mae/Hey!
23091/Mae/Hey!
23092/Table1/Do you mind? He's in a [speed=.5]pierogi trance[/speed]. Come back later.
23093/Mae/I come here all the time and I've never seen a pierogi trance.
23094/Table1/He's makin' something [speed=.5]extra special[/speed], [wave]dear.[/wave] Something that ain't never been pierogi'd before.
23095/Mae/Ugh. [color=aaaaaa]Dear.
23096/Mae/Hey, I just got back in town
23097/Mae/and the one thing I missed most was-
23098/Cook/HEY!
23099/Cook/I REMEMBER YOU!
23100/Mae/e_ĝoja e_brakosvinganta
23101/Mae/Hello!
23102/Cook/THIEF!
23103/Mae/e_neûtrala_1 e_neûtrala_2
23104/Mae/Oh COME ON.
23105/Mae/That was years ago!
23106/Cook/ONCE A THIEF, ALWAYS A THIEF.
23107/Mae/Alright, you know what? e_krinĝega
23108/Not Stated/I’m not a thief! You take that back!
23109/Not Stated/This isn't even a restaurant!
23110/Mae/I’ve stolen from better places than this! e_mira
23111/Mae/I wouldn’t lower myself to steal from here!
23112/Cook/YEAH YEAH YEAH
23113/Cook/GO JUMP IN THE RIVER.
23114/Mae/It's a crappy foodstand in a hole!
23115/Cook/This establishment has been in business for 50 years!
23116/Mae/50 CRAPPY YEARS IN A HOLE! e_mira
23117/Mae/You know what else has been in a hole for 50 years?
23118/Mae/e_brakoj_supren_gaje e_malĝoja
23119/Mae/DEAD PEOPLE FROM THE 60s!
23120/Cook/No respect! No respect, this one!
23121/Mae/YOU CAN KEEP YOUR HOLE PRETZELS
23122/Mae/AND YOUR DAMP PIEROGIES
23123/Mae/e_neûtrala_2 e_neûtrala_1
23124/Cook/YEAH YEAH YEAH
23125/Cook/GO JUMP IN THE RIVER.
23126/Mae/Usually someone fishing here. For tunnel fish. Because why the hell not.
23127/Mae/The tunnel flooded, and we lost a bit more land to the fish.
23128/Mae/I still can't believe they kept this place open after the flood took out the trolleys.
23129/Mae/Never underestimate the power of old people to get state funding.
23130/Mae/Which is why we have more war memorials than there were wars.
23131/Mae/We were at Aunt Janet's place up in Fort Lucenne when that flood hit.
23132/Mae/Our house had two feet of water in the living room when we came back.
23133/Mae/Mudslides took out a few houses in Underhill.
23134/Mae/Casey Hartley came by in his dad's boat.
23135/Mae/Gregg kept trying to ride his bike in the water and got stranded on top of a doghouse.
23136/Mae/We were at Aunt Janet's place up in Fort Lucenne when that flood hit.
23137/Mae/Our house had two feet of water in the living room when we came back.
23138/Mae/Mudslides took out a few houses in Underhill.
23139/Mae/Casey Hartley came by in his dad's boat.
23140/Mae/Gregg kept trying to ride his bike in the water and got stranded on top of a doghouse.
23141/Mae/Well if I can't get a pretzel this is basically a wet, underground old folks home.
23142/Mae/Can't even get into rest of the tunnel right now, but it's just as well.
23143/Mae/It's full of teens.
23144/Mae/Ugh. Teens.
23145/Mae/Always pretty empty in here this time of day.
23146/Mae/Don't know why they don't just close up until dinner time.
23147/Mae/e_krinĝega
23148/Mae/But whatever, screw this place. They won't sell me a pretzel anyway.
23149/Mae/e_mira
23150/Mae/It was years ago.
23151/Mae/It was one pretzel.
23152/Mae/I'm not a thief.
23153/Mae/But I was [shake=.01][size=1.2]HUNGRY
23154/Mae/What, did they want me to [size=1.2]STARVE[/all]?
23155/Mae/e_krinĝega
23156/Mae/They probably did.
23157/Mae/Monsters.
23158/Mae/e_mira
23159/Mae/I've stolen from better places than this!
23160/Fisherman/Pale white tunnel fish.
23161/Fisherman/Easy to catch and so delish.
23162/Mae/That’s good.
23163/Fisherman/Oh god you were listening
23164/Rosa/mmm. You’re Mae.
23165/Mae/yeah.
23166/Mae/do I know you?
23167/Rosa/you did when you were a baby child.
23168/Rosa/Miss Rosa.
23169/Mae/oh. Hm.
23170/Mae/i’m sorry.
23171/Rosa/it’s alright.
23172/Rosa/time does that.
23173/Rosa/you know, I knew your grandfather.
23174/Mae/oh really?
23175/Rosa/yes. Long ago.
23176/Rosa/if you’d like to ever talk about him
23177/Rosa/i got history to pass on
23178/Rosa/before i join him
23179/Rosa/heh heh
23180/Mae/oh.
23181/Mae/yeah, sure!
23182/Rosa/i’m here from time to time
23183/Rosa/stop by when you like
23184/Rosa/and we’ll have ourselves a talk.
23185/Rosa/history don’t keep itself
23186/Mae/sounds like a plan, Miss Rosa
23187/Rosa/until later, Mae Borowski.
23188/Rosa/Oh, hello Mae!
23189/Mae/Um.
23190/Mae/Do I know you?
23191/Rosa/I don't know if you remember me? Miss Rosa?
23192/Mae/Hm...
23193/Rosa/I knew your grandfather.
23194/Rosa/I visited you the day after you were born.
23195/Rosa/You were so small.
23196/Mae/...
23197/Rosa/I guess some things don’t change, eh?
23198/Mae/How did you know grandad?
23199/Rosa/I’m here most days, why don’t you stop by sometime
23200/Rosa/and I’ll tell you all about him?
23201/Rosa/things you might not know.
23202/Mae/Alright, you’ve got my interest.
23203/Rosa/Sweet curious child.
23204/Rosa/Oh, hello?
23205/Mae/hey. It’s mae.
23206/Rosa/i remember. Ol’ clock upstairs ain’t stopped yet.
23207/Mae/what did you want to tell me about granddad?
23208/Rosa/well i’ll only say if you really want to know...
23209/Not Stated/ha ha yes, i do want to know
23210/Not Stated/is it scandalous?
23211/Rosa/oh i don’t think so.
23212/Rosa/i’m old enough that nothing feels scandalous anyway.
23213/Mae/is that a thing that happens when you get old?
23214/Rosa/heh heh... depends on the life you led
23215/Mae/ok, anyway-
23216/Rosa/you got a history of troublemakers in your family.
23217/Rosa/on your daddy’s side in particular.
23218/Mae/oh?
23219/Rosa/go back far enough you got folks
23220/Rosa/that were around for the real hard times
23221/Rosa/when the workers went up against armies.
23222/Mae/oh yeah I kinda remember something about that.
23223/Mae/great-great-great-great grandpa or whatever.
23224/Mae/might have gotten the number of greats wrong there
23225/Rosa/your grandfather and i weren’t around for a lot of the violence
23226/Rosa/that was before even our time.
23227/Rosa/naw, we were around to watch the tide roll out.
23228/Mae/...and?
23229/Rosa/we’ll need to talk again another time.
23230/Rosa/i get tired.
23231/Mae/oh. Ok.
23232/Mae/can i get you anything?
23233/Mae/i don’t have any money.
23234/Rosa/naw, i’m just fine Mae.
23235/Rosa/we’ll talk another time.
23236/Mae/ok! See you!
23237/Mae/Hey Miss Rosa!
23238/Rosa/oh, hello mae.
23239/Mae/how are you feeling today?
23240/Rosa/oh, i feel the damp and the cold down here
23241/Rosa/but it’s in my bones wherever i go
23242/Rosa/so no harm.
23243/Mae/did you want to talk about granddad?
23244/Rosa/oh yes, where was i?
23245/Not Stated/something about a tide rolling out?
23246/Rosa/what?
23247/Rosa/oh right.
23248/Rosa/that was a metaphor.
23249/Mae/i figured.
23250/Not Stated/troublemakers in my family?
23251/Rosa/right
23252/Rosa/back then there were places that brought us all together
23253/Rosa/or at least brought us together in bits and bobs.
23254/Rosa/the Ol’ smokeys
23255/Rosa/the grand bears
23256/Rosa/the lodge of old
23257/Rosa/the church and the union.
23258/Rosa/there’d be dances
23259/Rosa/up at the H-Bee
23260/Rosa/that’s where I met your granddad, oh… a lifetime ago.
23261/Mae/what was he like back then?
23262/Rosa/Plain in most respects.
23263/Rosa/Prone to fits of melancholy
23264/Rosa/but funny, and wild when the occasion called.
23265/Rosa/surprising, is I guess the word.
23266/Mae/hm.
23267/Rosa/what’d your daddy say about him?
23268/Not Stated/strict but nice?
23269/Rosa/heh heh
23270/Rosa/strict is funny.
23271/Mae/why?
23272/Not Stated/distant but... trying?
23273/Rosa/sounds right
23274/Rosa/that sounds...
23275/Mae/you alright, Miss Rosa?
23276/Rosa/oh yes.
23277/Rosa/let’s talk another time.
23278/Mae/ok.
23279/Mae/hope you feel better?
23280/Rosa/oh mae
23281/Rosa/oh dear mae...
23282/Mae/oh hey Miss Rosa!
23283/Rosa/oh. Hello mae.
23284/Mae/feeling better?
23285/Rosa/as well as to be expected i s’pose.
23286/Mae/that’s good.
23287/Mae/did you want to talk about-
23288/Rosa/your grandfather.
23289/Mae/yeah
23290/Rosa/Possum Springs was built on our backs and the backs before us.
23291/Rosa/Time was they didn’t pay the people in real money
23292/Rosa/paid in little tokens and bills stamped with the company name
23293/Rosa/good at the company store
23294/Rosa/for company goods.
23295/Mae/back in school they showed us some of those.
23296/Mae/weird quarters and stuff.
23297/Rosa/your grandfather remembered. His daddy experienced it first hand.
23298/Rosa/mine boss came into town, driving a big fancy car
23299/Rosa/night i met your grandfather.
23300/Rosa/a real bastard, that boss, god forgive him.
23301/Rosa/your grandfather runs out of the dance,
23302/Rosa/i think he was a bit drunk. Or just stupid in some brave way.
23303/Rosa/he shouts “the guts of all bosses!”
23304/Rosa/he all of a sudden has a hunting knife from somewhere
23305/Rosa/and he slashes the boss’s tires.
23306/Mae/e_ĝoja
23307/Mae/ha ha ha ha wow!
23308/Rosa/picks up a rock, put it through the windshield
23309/Rosa/then he climbs up
23310/Rosa/i’m sorry, this part is a bit rude…
23311/Mae/holy shit don’t stop
23312/Rosa/he pees through the windshield hole.
23313/Mae/this is amazing!
23314/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
23315/Mae/did they catch him?
23316/Rosa/naw, just me and a few other folks saw it.
23317/Rosa/i trot over to him, and we run off down the alley
23318/Rosa/past the A-OK drug store
23319/Rosa/big field, big parking lot nowadays
23320/Rosa/stars fat and bright
23321/Rosa/i guess we were both pretty drunk
23322/Rosa/one thing led to another,
23323/Mae/oh. ok.
23324/Mae/wait... when was this...?
23325/Rosa/a... very long time ago.
23326/Mae/was he...
23327/Rosa/...
23328/Mae/...
23329/Rosa/...
23330/Mae/so what happened with the car?
23331/Rosa/got towed away.
23332/Rosa/police couldn’t get no witnesses.
23333/Rosa/we weren’t snitches about that kinda thing.
23334/Mae/damn right.
23335/Rosa/so like i said
23336/Rosa/you got troublemaker blood.
23337/Rosa/heh heh heh
23338/Mae/geez. I never knew this.
23339/Rosa/i don’t think your daddy even knows
23340/Mae/i bet not.
23341/Rosa/you gonna tell him?
23342/Not Stated/yes
23343/Mae/sometime
23344/Mae/maybe
23345/Not Stated/no
23346/Rosa/secret keeper like me, eh?
23347/Mae/i just think it’d be a weird conversation
23348/Rosa/you may find someday it isn’t so strange.
23349/Rosa/i wanted to pass this story along to you
23350/Rosa/it was one night, one thing he did
23351/Rosa/in a lifetime of nights and things he did
23352/Rosa/what you want to do with that, is part of your story now.
23353/Rosa/i can’t talk much more for today
23354/Mae/i’d like to know more about him!
23355/Mae/this was crazy.
23356/Rosa/...
23357/Rosa/i’ll see you, mae
23358/Rosa/sooner or later.
23359/Mae/ok.
23360/Mae/bye, Miss Rosa!
23361/Rosa/bye for now, Mae Borowski.
23362/Fisherman/Wife long gone, kids don’t care.
23363/Fisherman/Tunnel fish are always there.
23364/Mae/Ha ha yeah man.
23365/Fisherman/Oh god please don’t listen.
23366/Mae/e_brakosvinganta
23367/Mae/Hey Ms. Quelcy! Are you on... a phone?
23368/Mae/e_neûtrala_2
23369/MissQuelcy/Mae, I think I found signal.
23370/Mae/Oh my god.
23371/MissQuelcy/I know, Mae. I know.
23372/Not Stated/So how's art class this year?
23373/Not Stated/I'm surprised you even carry a phone around town. No one else does.
23374/MissQuelcy/Mae, you're scaring the signal away.
23375/MissQuelcy/I have a comprehensive internal database of unsecured wifi hotspots.
23376/Mae/That's scandalous.
23377/MissQuelcy/Me stealing wifi is about the 10th most scandalous thing involving a phone I've encountered this week.
23378/Mae/Oh?
23379/MissQuelcy/I caught several students earlier this week, back of the art room, looking at ...visual reference.
23380/Mae/Oh... e_malĝojeta
23381/MissQuelcy/I swear they should stop calling these smartphones and start calling them tupperware for porn.
23382/Mae/Yeah. They should call them that. e_neûtrala_1
23383/MissQuelcy/It's not like we get any signal in Possum Springs.
23384/MissQuelcy/If I see a kid with a phone I just assume they're carrying a smut bomb waiting to go off.
23385/MissQuelcy/Well, we're studying anatomy for figure drawing
23386/MissQuelcy/and I'm trying to somehow work it into the sex ed class this district won't allow us to have.
23387/Mae/I won't tell. e_ĝoja
23388/MissQuelcy/I guess if all else fails we could make onesies.
23389/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
23390/Mae/Well, best of luck with the signal!
23391/MissQuelcy/Hey, Mae? I know you just recently got back, but I have some free advice for you.
23392/Mae/What's that?
23393/MissQuelcy/Get out now while you still can.
23394/Mae/Um. Thanks. e_malĝojeta
23395/Mae/Why are you still here if you hate it so much?
23396/MissQuelcy/Child, I am paid to be here.
23397/Mae/Ok. Thanks?
23398/MissQuelcy/Run. Run away. Get a job in far away lands. Join the circus. Be not here.

23418/Mae/Yeah.
23419/TunnelTeen1/Oh ok.

23422/Mae/is anyone missing?
23423/TunnelTeen3/What?
23424/Mae/Like anyone you know who was out last night
23425/Mae/and didn't come back?
23426/TunnelTeen2/Uh.
23427/TunnelTeen4/I don't think so?
23428/TunnelTeen1/What's going on?
23429/Mae/Nothing. Thought I saw something.
23430/TunnelTeen3/Ok... uh...
23431/TunnelTeen1/You should tell us if this is something.
23432/Mae/Just be careful, ok? Keep an eye out
23433/Mae/and let me know if you see anything weird, ok?
23434/Mae/I mean you all hang out together constantly.

23438/TunnelTeen1/Hey don't you know Lori?
23439/Mae/Yeah.

23443/TunnelTeen3/Hey.
23444/Mae/So like... are you *always* together?
23445/TunnelTeen1/Yeah I guess.

23449/Mae/Yeah, like the buddy system.
23450/Mae/Safety in numbers!!!
23451/TunnelTeen4/You're a little paranoid, you know that?
23452/Mae/Kid, you don't even know.
23453/Mae/Anyone hear anything about anyone around here missing?
23454/TunnelTeen3/Uh, yeah actually.
23455/TunnelTeen3/There's some girl I know online
23456/TunnelTeen3/she hasn't been on since Harfest.
23457/Mae/Ok well I think we might need a bit more than that.
23458/TunnelTeen3/Ok.
23459/Mae/Is she from here? I could ask my aunt...
23460/TunnelTeen3/some place called Mulvay
23461/Mae/!!!! (eyes dilate, big frown)
23462/Mae/*Mulvay*?
23463/Mae/You know someone from *Mulvay*?
23464/TunnelTeen3/Yeah?
23465/Mae/Do you know where Mulvay is?
23466/Mae/Do you know *WHAT* Mulvay is?
23467/TunnelTeen3/No...
23468/TunnelTeen1/I heard about Mulvay.
23469/TunnelTeen1/My dad drives a bread truck.
23470/TunnelTeen1/Mulvay used to be one of his stops.
23471/Mae/What happened?
23472/TunnelTeen1/He don't stop there no more.
23473/TunnelTeen1/They had to pay some other guy to do it.
23474/Mae/Sounds about right.
23475/TunnelTeen3/WHAT'S Mulvay?
23476/TunnelTeen1/I'll take you out there this weekend.
23477/Mae/Don't.
23478/TunnelTeen1/It'll be fine. We'll just drive through.
23479/Mae/...
23480/Mae/I need to go get back in the sun now.
23481/Mae/So like... and I don't want this to sound weird, but...
23482/Mae/Do you know of anyone who's gone missing in the past couple days?
23483/TunnelTeen1/No?
23484/TunnelTeen4/Nah, not that I know of
23485/Mae/Ok, well tell me if you notice anyone is.
23486/TunnelTeen3/You are really spooking me.
23487/Mae/You and me both, kid.

23489/TunnelTeen1/Hey don't you know Lori?
23490/Mae/Yeah.

23503/Mae/nah, dude.
23504/Mae/nah.
23505/Mae/My babies are all fed. Momma don't need to steal today.
23506/Mae/Delicious pretzels...
23507/Mae/I bet some rat babies would love a delicious pretzel...
23508/Mae/ugh probably not gonna get another chance today. dammit.
23509/Mae/One pretzel is enough for my tiny rat darlings.
23510/Mae/
23511/Mae/HOLY SHIT.
23512/Mae/The Dudes! Someone hecked up the dudes!
23513/Mae/Who... did... this?
23514/Mae/Why did they do it?
23515/Fisherman/Many miners old and young
23516/Fisherman/With home in heart and coal in lung
23517/Fisherman/Were taken by the trolley men
23518/Fisherman/Up to the mine and back again
23519/Fisherman/But mudslide, flood, and awful storm
23520/Fisherman/Have given tunnel fishes ho... rm.
23521/Mae/"Horm?" e_ĝoja
23522/Fisherman/Please stop listening.
23523/Mae/e_neûtrala_1
23524/Mae/Amazing to think these things used to run.
23525/Mae/Kind of amazing they're still down here too.
23526/Mae/No way to get them out of here I guess.
23527/Mae/This place sure was something a long time ago.
23528/Mae/I can't believe they've kept this open.
23529/Mae/Historical note, I guess.
23530/Mae/I think it's just because the old people like the pierogi stand.
23531/Mae/Never underestimate the ability of old people to get state funding.
23532/Council1/Damn shame
23533/Council1/This was of historical note!
23534/Council1/Without it I don’t know if we can justify keeping this place open...
23535/Council1/
23536/Council1/Because this mural is of historical note, Molly!
23537/Council1/What do we know?
23538/Molly/Well, sometime overnight
23539/Molly/someone used bolt cutters on the gate
23540/Molly/and came down here.
23541/Council1/What’d they use, a paint roller?
23542/Molly/Looks to be.
23543/Council1/Says they intend to Nuke Poss... something?
23544/Molly/I think it’s likely some kid
23545/Molly/saw one of the old Nuke Possum Springs vandalisms from back when
23546/Molly/and got bored halfway through writing it.
23547/Council1/We need to treat this as a terrorist action.
23548/Molly/I’m... sorry?
23549/Council1/This mural is of historical note!
23550/Molly/Alright well I’ll round up any… uh… terrorists I see.
23551/Council1/Round up any dirtbag teens or vagrants that’ve been hanging around town
23552/Council1/check out by the abandoned Food Donkey.
23553/Council1/they come off the train there
23554/Molly/Already on it.
23555/Council1/Molly.
23556/Molly/Yeah?
23557/Council1/Find whoever did this.
23558/Molly/Ok.
23559/Council1/I want to see them hang.
23560/Molly/I think at most they’d get a fine and some jail time
23561/Molly/but alright. I’ll let you know when we’ve got something.
23562/TunnelTeen1/Eff off.
23563/Mae/No. Today *YOU* eff off.
23564/TunnelTeen1/Dang, bud.
23565/TunnelTeen1/Hey don't you know Lori?
23566/Mae/Yeah.

23575/TunnelTeen3/How old did you say you were?
23576/Mae/20
23577/TunnelTeen4/Told you she couldn't get us beer.
23578/Mae/What do you want beer for anyway?
23579/Mae/Beer is gross.
23580/Mae/It's not delicious at all.
23581/TunnelTeen1/Life ain't always delicious, mom.
23582/TunnelTeen2/Thought you'd know that by now.
23583/Mae/That doesn't even have any bearing on this.
23584/Mae/I hear there is actual good-tasting alcohol out there.
23585/Mae/I dunno. Fruit punch that makes you do things you regret.
23586/TunnelTeen3/Right.
23587/Mae/Am I uncool again?
23588/TunnelTeen4/You never were cool, mom.
23589/Mae/Dang.
23590/TunnelTeen1/But life ain't always cool.
23591/TunnelTeen2/Life is garbage.
23592/TunnelTeen3/But like, you know. Whatever.
23593/TunnelTeen4/Yeah. We're all trash anyway.
23594/TunnelTeen1/We belong here.
23595/Mae/Ok we can stop with the words of teenly wisdom now.
23596/Mae/Catch you later.
23597/Fisherman/Wife long gone, kids don’t care.
23598/Fisherman/Tunnel fish are always there.
23599/Mae/Ha ha yeah man.
23600/Fisherman/Oh god please don’t listen.
23601/Fisherman/Methinks I spy a tunnel shark
23602/Fisherman/Scary monster in the dark
23603/Mae/Holy crap!
23604/Fisherman/I didn't really see it.
23605/Fisherman/please don't listen.
23606/Fisherman/Will tunnel fish be always there?
23607/Fisherman/Will tunnel drain, canal be bare?
23608/Fisherman/I would miss the tunnel fish.
23609/Fisherman/To have them back would be my wish.
23610/Mae/are they gonna drain the tunnel or something?
23611/Fisherman/No. It's poetry, ok?
23612/Fisherman/I'm just making stuff up!
23613/Fisherman/Please don't listen!!!
23614/Fisherman/When winter come and water freeze
23615/Fisherman/Here the fish can be at ease
23616/Fisherman/the tunnel is not flooded ruin
23617/Fisherman/it's a home, a place for doin'
23618/Mae/Sure. That works.
23619/Fisherman/please go away.
23620/Mae/Cool that people still hang around down here.

23881/Salvi/and bugs like light
23882/Salvi/so you’re gonna shine that light all around ‘em and get ‘em to scatter
23883/Salvi/lookin’ for bugs.
23884/Salvi/they mostly go away for a while when they scatter.

23980/Mae/did the cops ever catch the guy?
23981/Salvi/oh no. he’s still out there.

24001/Mae/i couldn’t really see them?
24002/Salvi/oh boy. They’re still here then.
24003/Salvi/hangin’ there.
24004/Salvi/with their beady eyes
24005/Salvi/and fangs
24006/Salvi/and w...w...wings!!!
24007/Mae/why do you hate bats so much?
24008/Salvi/they’re horrible, that’s why!
24009/Salvi/Comin' up on another island.
24010/Mae/how many of these are down here?
24011/Salvi/oh, I ain’t counted.
24012/Salvi/seem to find new ones all the time.
24013/Salvi/and lose old ones.
24014/Mae/spooky.
24015/Salvi/we’re pretty far back now. It’s always a bit spooky.
24016/Mae/whoa. Old trolley car over there.
24017/Salvi/yeah we’re getting close to where the flood really hit hardest.
24018/Mae/I can’t imagine this place still up and running.
24019/Salvi/it was quite something.
24020/Salvi/had a sense of... going somewhere.
24021/Mae/yeah.
24022/Salvi/way back when they got these “new” trolley cars
24023/Salvi/they were designed by some company overseas
24024/Salvi/big and fancy, like france or somethin’.
24025/Mae/they are pretty.
24026/Salvi/yeah they still got their charms.
24027/Salvi/you gonna look around?
24028/Mae/sure.
24029/Mae/oh huh.
24030/Mae/wonder how old this is?
24031/Mae/it’s pretty soggy
24032/Mae/what sport even is this?
24033/Mae/it’s a sports mystery.
24034/Mae/the worst kind of mystery.
24035/Mae/it’s pretty though.
24036/Mae/do I want this thing?
24037/Mae/more than the very functional helmet?
24038/Not Stated/yeah
24039/Mae/could hang it on the wall.
24040/Mae/that’d be pretty neat.
24041/Mae/and then look up what it’s even for.
24042/Mae/cool cool cool.
24043/Not Stated/nah
24044/Mae/it’s gross and i don’t care about sports.
24045/Mae/anymore.
24046/Mae/oh nice!
24047/Mae/Football, our official religion around here.
24048/Mae/I could totally wear this.
24049/Mae/It’s functional!
24050/Mae/I could totally wear this in the winter, in case I slip on the ice.
24051/Mae/I could wear this if I was in a fight.
24052/Mae/could probably stop a bullet even. I dunno.
24053/Mae/It smells inside though...
24054/Mae/do I want this thing?
24055/Mae/more than that ancient flag thing?
24056/Not Stated/yeah
24057/Mae/it’s functional!
24058/Not Stated/nah
24059/Mae/it’s functional, but
24060/Mae/the flaggy thing is mysterious.
24061/Mae/Gotta go with the mystery.
24062/Mae/hmmm.
24063/Salvi/Find anything good?
24064/Mae/nah.
24065/Mae/Check this out!
24066/Salvi/oh wow that’s an old hockey pennant.
24067/Mae/how old?
24068/Mae/like really old?
24069/Salvi/uh. 1970s? 80s?
24070/Mae/oh. That’s like
24071/Mae/medium old.
24072/Mae/we had a hockey team back then?
24073/Salvi/sure did!
24074/Salvi/ice arena used to be out by where ham panther is now.
24075/Mae/geez. So much stuff used to be here.
24076/Salvi/lots still here.
24077/Salvi/but yeah. Lots gone.
24078/Mae/Football helmet!
24079/Salvi/oh... you sure you want that?
24080/Mae/did i finally find something you want?
24081/Salvi/well... i mean... it’s cool. You take it.
24082/Mae/no, it’s alright.
24083/Mae/it’s your boat. It’s your garbage.
24084/Mae/you can have it.
24085/Salvi/no, that’s fine Mae.
24086/Mae/no, i think you should have it.
24087/Salvi/no Mae. you take it.
24088/Mae/TAKE IT.
24089/Salvi/I DON’T WANT IT
24090/Mae/NEITHER DO I - TAKE IT
24091/Salvi/IT’S YOURS
24092/Mae/GODDAMMIT YOU TAKE THIS EFFING HELMET
24093/Salvi/NO!!!
24094/Mae/AAAAAAARGH YOU GO STRAIGHT TO HELL!!!!!
24095/Salvi/are you ok?
24096/Mae/yeah. Sorry I yelled.
24097/Salvi/me too.
24098/Salvi/you happy with your helmet?
24099/Mae/yeah! It’s functional!
24100/Mae/any more bats to get rid of?
24101/Salvi/nah. They don’t come back this far to sleep.
24102/Salvi/they fly around a good bit back here though
24103/Salvi/unless you clear em off before you get here.
24104/Mae/where even are we?
24105/Salvi/almost to the far platform.
24106/Mae/oh wow. Is that where we’re going?
24107/Salvi/well
24108/Salvi/you got rid of most of the bats back there...
24109/Salvi/so maybe we can make one last stop
24110/Salvi/at the big one.
24111/Mae/"the big one?"
24112/Salvi/yeah... don’t think we got rid of enough bats back there
24113/Salvi/for them to not be a problem back here
24114/Mae/oh. Sorry.
24115/Salvi/ain’t no worry.
24116/Salvi/we’ll head on out to the far platform.
24117/Salvi/I thank god I wasn’t down here when the flood hit.
24118/Mae/the river jumped, right?
24119/Salvi/yeah. Flood was bad enough, river just up and moved.
24120/Salvi/had something to do with the reservoir too, i forget.
24121/Mae/I guess it was a while ago.
24122/Mae/weird to think that rivers can move.
24123/Salvi/oh they’re always moving, kid.
24124/Mae/(20 year old)
24125/Salvi/they’re just usually moving in one direction.
24126/Salvi/no one’s really prepared for when it stops doing
24127/Salvi/what it’s always been doing.
24128/Mae/hm.
24129/Salvi/alright, here we are.
24130/Salvi/the big one.
24131/Mae/wow.
24132/Mae/this looks like something I dreamed
24133/Mae/or something.
24134/Mae/it’s familiar someways.
24135/Salvi/Back then they thought the trolleys would stay on the track
24136/Salvi/come a big flood.
24137/Salvi/but nah. They went right along with the water.
24138/Salvi/bobbing up and down
24139/Salvi/crashing into big piles like this.
24140/Mae/geez.
24141/Salvi/can’t fix something like this
24142/Salvi/what’re you gonna do?
24143/Salvi/dam up the river? Dig this whole thing out?
24144/Salvi/nobody got that money.
24145/Salvi/nobody got that time.
24146/Mae/this is like
24147/Mae/visiting some place beyond the grave
24148/Mae/like where you go when you die
24149/Salvi/some folks *did* die down here
24150/Mae/oh yeah.
24151/Salvi/you gonna go look around?
24152/Salvi/hafta say, not much back this far usually.
24153/Salvi/most stuff washes in from side channels
24154/Salvi/gets caught up back where we came from.
24155/Mae/yeah. I think i’ll still look around.
24156/Mae/wow.
24157/Mae/wonder if it still works?
24158/Mae/should probably clean all of the mud out of it first.
24159/Mae/do i want to take this?
24160/Mae/even more than the lock?
24161/Not Stated/yeah
24162/Mae/it’s really pretty.
24163/Mae/it should have someone to appreciate it.
24164/Not Stated/nah
24165/Mae/i got nowhere to put it.
24166/Mae/and i can’t play it.
24167/Mae/also feel like some horn-playing ghost is gonna haunt me
24168/Mae/if i take it from here.
24169/Mae/wonder what this used to lock up?
24170/Mae/really old lock.
24171/Mae/pretty neat key.
24172/Mae/someone bought this to keep something safe
24173/Mae/or secret
24174/Mae/do i want to take this?
24175/Mae/more than the muddy horn?
24176/Not Stated/yeah
24177/Mae/this thing has like
24178/Mae/someone’s intentions in it
24179/Mae/or something.
24180/Mae/it feels heavy.
24181/Mae/someone should have it.
24182/Not Stated/nah
24183/Mae/it’s just junk now.
24184/Mae/and i got nothing to lock up anyways.
24185/Salvi/Find anything good?
24186/Mae/nah.
24187/Mae/horn.
24188/Salvi/looks like a packhorn, maybe?
24189/Mae/i’m gonna clean it out
24190/Mae/maybe play it.
24191/Mae/or at least make it make some noise.
24192/Salvi/good plan.
24193/Mae/it’s real pretty
24194/Mae/shame to leave it down here.
24195/Salvi/you rescued it.
24196/Mae/i’m a hero.
24197/Salvi/i’ll call the papers.
24198/Mae/got a lock and a key
24199/Salvi/oh. What are you gonna do with that?
24200/Mae/i dunno. I just figured someone should have it.
24201/Salvi/hm.
24202/Salvi/that’s thoughtful, Mae.
24203/Mae/i feel like we’re a thousand miles away from Possum Springs.
24204/Salvi/yeah. We’re not so far though.
24205/Salvi/let’s get going.
24206/Salvi/here we are
24207/Mae/wow.
24208/Mae/ha ha ha
24209/Salvi/what?
24210/Mae/there’s some beer cans and a mattress back here
24211/Mae/and a spot where a fire was
24212/Mae/and a sock
24213/Mae/and some weed, it looks like
24214/Mae/someone did some partying back here
24215/Salvi/ha ha ha ha. That must be new!
24216/Mae/Teens. It was the teens.
24217/Salvi/ha ha ha.
24218/Salvi/There is nowhere you can go that the teens have not been already.
24219/Mae/oh god... the mattress...
24220/Salvi/that’s unsavory
24221/Mae/who’s idea was it to get high, drunk, and then boink
24222/Mae/way back here?
24223/Salvi/it does seem a lot of trouble to go to.
24224/Mae/this is hilarious.
24225/Salvi/it’s very funny.
24226/Salvi/so that’s it. That’s the other mural.
24227/Mae/...
24228/Mae/it’s so...
24229/Mae/...
24230/Salvi/yeah.
24231/Mae/yeah.
24232/Salvi/basically the only thing back here that survived the flood.
24233/Mae/...
24234/Salvi/i just think it’s nice that it’s not gone.
24235/Mae/yeah i guess.
24236/Mae/forgotten maybe, but not gone.
24237/Salvi/well... not forgotten yet.
24238/Mae/i wonder if in like 500 years
24239/Mae/some archeologists will find it
24240/Mae/and wonder what it meant.
24241/Salvi/sometimes I think in 50 years no one will know what it meant.
24242/Mae/places can’t control how they’re remembered
24243/Mae/they just... hang out...
24244/Mae/and then fall apart.
24245/Salvi/you ok, mae?
24246/Mae/yeah.
24247/Mae/i’ll be fine.
24248/Mae/i’m just gonna look for a minute.
24249/Salvi/take your time.
24250/Mae/...
24251/Mae/Hello? Are you dead?
24252/Mae/Did you get run over?
24253/Rick/Nah kid I’m just fixin' 'er up.
24254/Mae/Isn't it dangerous to be under a car on a hill?
24255/Rick/I do not fear death, kid.
24256/Mae/Adult.
24257/Rick/Death fears me.
24258/Mae/yeah ok but
24259/Rick/I'll drive this car right over the grim reaper.
24260/Mae/ok.
24261/Mae/Do you live here or something?
24262/Rick/Yeah kid, Rekkage Manor is right behind you.
24263/Mae/Adult.
24264/Mae/Wait a sec- are you Rick Rekkage?
24265/Mae/Like, The Creeping Deadlies Rick Rekkage?
24266/Rick/Yeah kid. I’m him. He’s me.
24267/Mae/How’s the band?
24268/Rick/Great. Playin' out. Free beer.
24269/Rick/Stop by the bar some night and see us!
24270/Mae/I’m not 21 yet.
24271/Rick/Aw don't worry kid. You'll be a real person soon.
24272/Mae/Adu-
24273/Mae/whatever.
24274/Rick/
24275/Mae/Hello child.
24276/StoopKid/What do you want?
24277/Not Stated/Your blooooood.
24278/Not Stated/What are you doing?
24279/StoopKid/Watching squirrels. Squirrels are weird.
24280/Mae/They're really just fancy rats.
24281/StoopKid/How much of it?
24282/Mae/All of it. Every last drop of sweet, sweet child bloooood.
24283/StoopKid/Are you a monster lady?
24284/Mae/The most monster of all ladies.
24285/StoopKid/My mom says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
24286/Mae/Why?
24287/StoopKid/Because one time you hurt somebody and no one knows when you might do it again.
24288/Mae/That was a long time ago.
24289/StoopKid/She says you had a lot going for you but you threw it in the garbage.
24290/Mae/Your mom sounds great.
24291/StoopKid/She says you didn't even try when you went to college

24408/LizChandler/and climb in my window.
24409/Mae/oh geez. That’s spooky.
24410/LizChandler/You never want someone hanging around outside your window.
24411/Mae/not magical evil statues at least.

24413/Mae/I live in the attic. No one can get to my window.

24418/Mae/see ya!
24419/Council1/...that doesn’t really answer the question, Colleen.

24423/Council1/cars slipsliding all up and down this goddamn hill! Colleen!

24426/Council4/it’s not giving up Colleen!!!
24427/Council4/i’m sick of you undermining me!
24428/Council2/it’s a bad idea! That’s not undermining!

24441/Council2/yeah Cathleen. Too cold for another stupid idea.

24443/Council3/we could just hire some private plows.
24444/Council2/if you want to go against the D.O.T. union go right ahead
24445/Council2/we got agreements with the county and state.
24446/Council1/Colleen’s right on this one too.
24447/Council4/if you two agree so much why don’t you just get married already?!?
24448/Council2/UGH!
24449/Council1/I’d rather die!

24462/Mae/I'm great at crimes.
24463/Bea/But what if I get caught?
24464/Mae/You won't. I'll just start screaming if I have to.
24465/Bea/How is that a good idea?

24605/Mae/We bless thee, lord, for hearing the prayers of your humble servant.

24709/Angus/Mostly the adult section back behind the curtain.
24710/Mae/WHOA, really?
24711/Angus/Yeah some folks are like really into seeking them out.
24712/Angus/It's like a whole little scene that goes back before the internet.
24713/Angus/We had a historian in there last month looking for some obscure video.
24714/Mae/How do you get THAT job?
24715/Angus/I think that's the kind of job you can only have
24716/Angus/if you don’t need to have a job.
24717/Mae/So this party tonight, huh?
24718/Angus/Yeah. Should be fun?
24719/Mae/I hadn't pegged you as a party person.
24720/Angus/I'm not really. But parties with Gregg are different.
24721/Mae/How so?
24722/Angus/You know how you want to just go and stand in a corner sometimes?
24723/Mae/Yeah.
24724/Angus/Gregg's my corner.
24725/Mae/Awwww.
24726/Angus/Ha ha shut up
24727/Mae/See ya later!
24728/Angus/For sure!
24729/VideostoreGirl/Can I help you?
24730/Mae/Where's Angus?
24731/VideostoreGirl/Oh he works dayshift?
24732/Mae/It is day?
24733/VideostoreGirl/I got here early?
24734/Mae/Any idea where he is?
24735/VideostoreGirl/I assume he went home?
24736/VideostoreGirl/He lives next door?
24737/VideostoreGirl/Go inside and ring the buzzer?
24738/Mae/Wait. Why does everything you say sound like a question?
24739/VideostoreGirl/You do the same thing?
24740/VideostoreGirl/I just didn’t comment on it?
24741/Mae/Really?
24742/VideostoreGirl/Yeah?
24743/Mae/Huh?
24744/VideostoreGirl/Can I help you?
24745/Mae/I don't think so...
24746/VideostoreGirl/
24747/VideostoreGirl/
24748/Angus/Hey Mae.
24749/Mae/Hey Angus. How's it going?
24750/Angus/You are like the third person I've seen today.
24751/Mae/I know you've explained it but I have zero clue how this place stays open.
24752/Angus/You'd be surprised.
24753/Mae/Band practice later?
24754/Angus/Gotta warm up my voice!
24755/Mae/You growl real good.
24756/Angus/Thanks. I'm a born growler.
24757/Angus/When I was a baby I never cried
24758/Angus/I just growled.
24759/Mae/I think I cried nonstop until I was like 9
24760/Mae/and then I cried all the time again starting at like 13...
24761/Angus/You had a good three years of not crying in there!
24762/Mae/They were really productive years.
24763/Angus/Heh heh.
24764/Angus/You up for band practice in a bit?
24765/Mae/I guess. Weird night.
24766/Angus/How so?
24767/Mae/I'll tell you about it later.
24768/Angus/So, I said I could like
24769/Angus/take you up to the park.
24770/Mae/you did indeed.
24771/Angus/You ready to go?
24772/Not Stated/Naw
24773/Not Stated/Yeah
24774/Angus/Hey Mae.
24775/Mae/Hey dude.
24776/Mae/Totally what's up.
24777/Angus/Nothing.
24778/Mae/You ok?
24779/Angus/Yep.
24780/Mae/...ok
24781/Angus/Sorry. Don't mind me.
24782/Angus/My legs are still sore from running from that dude.
24783/Mae/I'm just sore in general.
24784/Mae/and tired.
24785/Mae/in general.
24786/Angus/My life doesn't involve a lot of running.
24787/Mae/heh heh
24788/Mae/I feel like I should have
24789/Mae/some sort of clever comment to follow that up.
24790/Angus/You can get back to me.
24791/Angus/So, I said I could like
24792/Angus/take you up to the park.
24793/Mae/you did indeed.
24794/Mae/I'm so tired.
24795/Angus/you gonna be ok?
24796/Mae/yeah, i'll be fine
24797/Angus/You up for this park trip?
24798/Not Stated/Naw

24800/Mae/Wow. Bea let you have the car two nights in a row?
24801/Angus/yeah

24803/Angus/Well, I mean, you can’t really do anything about that
24804/Angus/and I replaced the tire.
24805/Mae/Oh yeah.
24806/Mae/Cool you could borrow her car, though.
24807/Mae/I had to ride on Gregg’s bike
24808/Mae/when we saw that ghost.
24809/Angus/Yeah Gregg needs to get his license.
24810/Mae/I fell off his bike.
24811/Mae/which I *also* did a few days before that
24812/Mae/I’M EXCITED! e_brakoj_supren_gaje

24817/Mae/it’ll be nice to actually get to know you a little better!
24818/Angus/I’m pretty great.
24819/Mae/Ghost hunting with Angus!
24820/Angus/So you think the guy you saw was a ghost?
24821/Mae/not a guy- a GHOST
24822/Angus/right.
24823/Mae/Why does no one believe me that it was a ghost?
24824/Angus/Well, I mean… Ghosts don’t actually exist.
24825/Mae/I’m pretty sure they do.
24826/Angus/Well, I’d need evidence.
24827/Mae/What counts?
24828/Angus/A ghost walking up and saying hello
24829/Angus/and me saying hey I’ve verified you are a dead person.
24830/Mae/Could be a zombie or a frankenstein.
24831/Angus/ok maybe if they’re made of ghosty stuff
